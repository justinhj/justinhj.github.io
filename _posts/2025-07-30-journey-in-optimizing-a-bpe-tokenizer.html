<h2 id="org2e0801c">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2e0801c">
<p>
In February 2024, renowned AI researcher and educator Andrej Karpathy, published the following video. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE</a>
</p>

<p>
An excellent introduction to the fascinating topic of tokenization,
something he considers a necessary evil right now. Maybe the need for
it will go away but for now it must be well understood by AI engineers
in order to get good results when building and using large language
models.
</p>

<p>
As software engineers in 2025 the advent of large language models, and
generative AI in general, bring about a profound shift in how we
design, develop and implement software systems. As such I have been
delving into the details of how they they work, with Tokenization being
a significant side quest.
</p>

<p>
In this blog, related video and accompanying C++ project, I will walk
through my exploration of the training aspect of tokenizers and look
at their performance characteristics and optimization opportunities.
</p>

<p>
My main goal was to port the Python to C++ but also I became interested in optimizing the training stage.
</p>

<p>
Training SOTA (State of the Art) models is a massive expense in terms of time and computation needed. The Llama 3 model was trained on 15 trillion tokens, and although it is not known, its tokenizer may also have been trained on the whole data set. Even if it used only a smaller representative sample, tokenizer training is also a huge expense.
</p>

<p>
For that reason it stands to reason you would want to optimize it as much as possible so that changes to the data set or algorithm can be made more easily and quickly.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, I was able to reduce the training time by a factor of 23 (for the large wikitext input) as shown below.

I don't want to even try and do a better job of explaining the need
for tokenization and the BPE algorithm than Karpathy, so I instead
recommend watching his video and, for additional insights, read the
paper below:
</p>

<p>

<li>Large language models deal with numbers not words or characters, so we must map input text to numbers.</li>

<h3 id="org61241d9">Sub word unit tokenization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org61241d9">
<p>
The solution to these issues is sub-word tokenization; splitting words
up into numbers representing components of words. Once you have that
you can handle:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Open-Vocabulary</b> Part of the token set is the basic characters of each language so you can represent every word.</li>
<li><b>Rare words</b> Because the vocabulary set is open it means any rare word is handled.</li>
<li><b>Translation of Novel Words</b> The model can translate and generate words it has not encountered before by composing them from sub-word units.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is a diagram showing how the fixed sized vocabulary of tokens maps to an array of learned embedding vectors that feed into the Transformer model underlying all LLMs.

  Input Embeddings

<p>
Tokenization means taking text and splitting it into sub-word (and whole-word or even multi-word) units. An input text like <code>"My cat, Blivarian, is making a mess."</code> may be tokenized into something like this:
</p>

<p>
You can explore this tokenization here:
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer</a>

</p>

<p>
Notice that the commas have the same token value when appearing in
different places. Also that common words like cat and mess have their
own tokens.
</p>

<p>
I deliberately made up a name for the made up Cat that is not a real
word "Blivarian". You can see that it is split up into 3 sub
words. Without tokenization this would instead have been stored with a
special "Out of vocabulary" token, that means it carries no semantic
meaning. When dealing with sub word tokens however, the LLM has the
opportunity to build up meaning for those components that may help
with overall model quality.

<h4 id="org6a0c0da">Why BPE?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6a0c0da">
<p>
From above we understand that we should split words into sub-word
components to handle the vast space of human vocabulary in the finite
space of the LLMs vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
How to do that is the next question. Why not, for example, just have a
vocabulary consisting of the punctuation and alphabetic characters of
every language?
</p>

<p>
It won't work well because in the LLM training it will build up an
embedding vector for each token, the unit of vocabulary. This vector
is an array of numbers that represents a direction in multidimensional
space. To us those numbers mean nothing, but in LLM training those
numbers, when used in conjunction with the rest of the models weights,
can be used to learn and represent all kinds of meaning.
</p>

<p>
Models like Transformers have a finite context window. When sequences
are excessively long, it becomes much harder for the model to capture
long-range dependencies and relationships between words that are far
apart. The model has to work harder to understand the overall context.
</p>

<p>
Instead we want something that splits things into meaningful chunks, morphemes, as well as capturing commonly used words with tokens. This ends up looking something like Huffman Encoding:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding</a>
</p>

<p>
It represents more frequently occurring substrings with less bits, giving us a more efficient data size.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, BPE, is data-driven algorithm that creates a vocabulary of meaningful and frequently occurring subword units.

<h4 id="orgcab669d">BPE algorithm</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcab669d">
<p>
First you need to train across a large corpus of realistic text. For
state of the art (SOTA) LLMs this is likely in the trillions of
characters of data.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm itself is very simple, it works as follows:
</p>

<p>
Start with 256 tokens (0 to 255), our basic character set.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First turn the text into its underlying numeric representation (typically just the bytes of a UTF-8 input).</li>
<li>Count all the pairs of bytes. </li>
<li>Pick the most frequently occurring pair and generate the next new token (257, 258&#x2026;).</li>
<li>Replace that pair wherever it occurs with the new token.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Repeat until you have your full vocabulary. You can then save the
merge pairs and these are then used by end users to encode their text
before sending to the model.
</p>

<p>
They can also be used to reconstruct the original text in the decoding
process when the response comes from the model.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org60512a5">
<p>
An important decision in tokenization is how to handle pairs with the same frequency. In this post I'll consider two methods:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First in corpus wins. </li>
<li>Lexicographical ordering.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With any tokenization algorithm design we need to consider efficiency
of implementation alongside methods that give the best results. Some
of these concerns will be highlighted below.

With these algorithmic decisions in mind, I was ready to dive into the
C++ implementation and see how they performed in practice. This led to
my project, minbpe-cc. I find the best way to learn a topic is to get
my hands dirty, and as such I decided to reimplement Karpathy's Python
code in C++.

I also wanted to focus on optimization of the training stage, for no

<p>
The final code here fully implements all the facets of Karpathy's minbpe including encoding, decoding and training. I've included end to end tests and tested in a linux and MacOS environment. I have not tested on Windows yet, but I expect it will work without much modification.

<p>
Converting from Python to C++ is fairly straightforward although I hit some speed bumps on the way:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Python dictionary behaviour. The Python dictionary is designed to be flexible for multiple purposes rather than optimized, so getting the same behaviour from C++ containers required some additional thought.</li>
<li>Polymorphism. I didn't really like Karpathy's polymorphic version and instead decided to use a single class design with flags and other parameters to handle whether special tokens are used, what the conflict strategy was, and whether to use a regex or not. It was quite easy to make this work with some tweaks to the original code. Ironically I did use polymorphism on the PairCount class so I can use different implementations at runtime depending on the users preferences.</li>
<li>CMake. CMake is not a casual tool. I found I could just about get my project to build and run using it, but after switching to Zig build instead I found it much easier to manage. In other words to effectively use CMake would require me to read the manual in a lot more detail.</li>

<h3 id="orgfb58706">Regex compatibility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfb58706">
<p>
Firstly, what are regexes needed for? 
</p>

<p>
In the GPT series of tokenizers, OpenAI realized that it is beneficial to
try and keep parts of text together, as such rather than run BPE on
the whole input text, they first divide it up into sections by the
following regular expressions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GPT2 <code>"'(?:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+"</code></li>
<li>GPT4 <code>"'(?i:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)|[^\\r\\n\\p{L}\\p{N}]?+\\p{L}+|\\p{N}{1,3}| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]++[\\r\\n]*|\\s*[\\r\\n]|\\s+(?!\\S)|\\s+"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
These expressions are designed to preserve various aspects of English text rather than allow them to be split up during the merge process.
</p>

<p>
Whilst there are a few established regex libraries for C++ (writing my own being out of scope for this project), finding one that was capable of handling these regular expressions took some looking. 
</p>

<p>
These expressions need support for unicode matchers and also negative lookahead.
</p>

<p>
I compared several libraries:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>RE2 from Google.</li>
<li>std::regex in the C++ standard library.</li>
<li>Boost::regex</li>
<li>Re-Flex</li>
</ol>

<p>
None of these met the requirements. 
</p>

<p>
In the end I found the Perl compatible PRE2 library worked the best.
</p>

<p>
The biggest footgun was that the Boost::regex library was asserting
because Boost was not linking properly with the ICU
(internationalization) library. I suspect this could be made to work
but I gave up.

Because the body text required sequential access and the ability to quickly remove elements I used a singly linked list, or <code>forward_list</code>. This has the desirable properties of sequential access and O(1) deletions.
</p>

<p>
<code>forward_list</code> has the lowest memory overhead of all std C++ containers (a single pointer to the next element.

<li>Keep in a vector but use tombstones for removed items. This has the</li>

Ultimately I needed multiple structures here as I wanted to support more than one conflict resolution strategy and since these are picked by the user at runtime we need dynamic dispatch. So first I made a virtual class with the required interface for both:

Note that the class has a template parameter, as the Tokenizer can be recompiled with different underlying numeric types for the tokens.

<blockquote>
<p>
In Python this insertion order comes for free because of Raymond
Hettinger's 2012 redesign of the Python dictionary. Implemented in
Python 3.6 (released December 23, 2016), introduced compact
dictionaries with key-sharing and faster performance. A side effect of
this redesign was that dictionaries began preserving insertion order
as an implementation detail. This was later formalized as a language
guarantee in Python 3.7 (released June 27, 2018), meaning dictionaries
officially maintain the order of key-value pairs as they are inserted.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Karpathy's code you can see that he simply relies on this behaviour
to get the consistent result based on above.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a8a8a8;"># </span><span style="color: #a8a8a8;">count up the number of times every consecutive pair appears</span>

<span style="color: #a8a8a8;"># </span><span style="color: #a8a8a8;">find the pair with the highest count</span>
<span style="color: #00d3d0;">pair</span> = <span style="color: #f78fe7;">max</span>(stats, key=stats.get)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And from the Python documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one
encountered. This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving
tools such as sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc, reverse=True)[0] and
heapq.nlargest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc).
</p>

<p>
In order to implement that we must track the insertion order. Rather
than let the user deal with that I built it into the PairCount
class. As elements are added, new ones get the current count and the
count is incremented.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Picking a data structure here is tricky because we want to be able to
quickly store and modify pair frequencies (unordered<sub>map</sub>), and a way
to get the most frequent (priority<sub>queue</sub>). Furthermore, we want to
keep track of insertion order?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you need to use multiple data structures to support a use case with conflicting requirements. For this purpose I used the <code>boost::multi_index</code>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_88_0/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html">https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_88_0/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>
There's nothing to stop you from using a set and a priority queue and
tracking them yourself, but multi<sub>index</sub> handles that for you based on
the declaration of which indexes and access patterns you need.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at the implementation of <code>PairCountInsertOrder</code>:
</p>

<p>
First the data; we need to store pair, the count and the insert order.

&#160; &#160; }
};
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next we define the container itself. We just specify the indexes required and Boost takes care of picking the underlying data structures.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c++"><span style="color: #b6a0ff;">template</span>&lt;<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">typename</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">T</span>&gt;

&#160; &#160; &gt;
&gt;;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Index 0 explanation:
It is hashed so we should get an O(1) lookup type, and unique meaning keys are unique, each pair can occur once only.
The rest of the declaration explains how to get the key for this index (use the pair member).
</p>

<p>
Index 1 explanation: 
This needs to be an ordered collection so we can extract the highest
frequency. It also needs to be non-unique (in its sort criteria),
because we can have multiple elements with the same frequency.
</p>

<p>
Now in our code we can grab the appropriate index depending on the
current purpose and when we make modifications to the data the boost
library will ensure the changes are synchronized across all the
indexes in the container.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C++"><span style="color: #b6a0ff;">auto</span>&amp; <span style="color: #00d3d0;">index_by_key</span> = pcs.<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">template</span> get&lt;0&gt;();

} <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">else</span> {
&#160; &#160; pcs.insert(PairCountOrder&lt;T&gt;(mp, freq, next_insert++));
&#160; &#160; <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">return</span> <span style="color: #00bcff;">true</span>;
}

</li>

<li><a id="org68fb120"></a>Conflict resolution strategy: Lexicographical<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org68fb120">
<p>
Referred to as lexical in my implementation to save typing, this method means we pick from pairs based on which comes first. For example given the following two pairs:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>[1,2] =&gt; 20 </li>
<li>[3,4] =&gt; 20</li>
</ol>

<p>
They have the same frequency so we pick pair 1) as 1 &lt; 3. The second member
of the pair is used as the tie-breaker, and of course if both members
are the same then they would be combined to a single entry in the
PairCount.
</p>

<p>
Again a multi<sub>index</sub> container is needed here. Let's start with the data:

Index 0 explanation:
Same as above this gives us fast insert, modify and lookup for the pair frequencies.
</p>

<p>
Index 1 explanation:
Same as above except the outcome is different because of the implementation of <code>CompareLexicalOrder</code>.

<li><a id="orgecc25d2"></a>Optimization of frequency counts<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgecc25d2">
<p>
When running the code I see that the biggest cost is regenerating the
frequency map each step. For example when churning through wikitext (a
500mb text corpus) it takes the Python code 28 seconds on my Macbook
to count all the pairs.
</p>

<p>
Let's work through Brendan Gregg's impactful optimizations:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Don’t do it.</li>
<li>Do it, but don’t do it again.</li>
<li>Do it less.</li>
<li>Do it later.</li>
<li>Do it when they’re not looking.</li>
<li>Do it concurrently.</li>
<li>Do it more cheaply.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Don't do it is not an option, we need those updated counts each step. 
Do it but not again is fruitful though. 
</p>

<p>
The key insight here is that we only need to do a full frequency count
one time. Then we can incrementally update the pair frequencies as we
walk through doing the merge process. Essentially we are removing and
adding a number of pairs on each replacement.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the authors of the paper mentioned this too: 
</p>

<p>
"In practice, we increase efficiency by indexing all pairs, and updating data structures incrementally."
</p>

<p>
You can see their incremental update code here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt/blob/92d6139d07d30e12735a0af9e7f7f925ebe62c54/subword_nmt/learn_bpe.py#L159">https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt/blob/92d6139d07d30e12735a0af9e7f7f925ebe62c54/subword_nmt/learn_bpe.py#L159</a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to this optimization they use a pruning technique that
drops frequencies of pairs below some threshold. This makes sense
because the Python max function iterates the whole collection. In my
case our data structures do not, so pruning is probably not worth the
additional complexity. Worth trying maybe?
</p>

<p>
In any case, for my lexicographical conflict strategy I do implement
this optimization and it is a huge win on performance as shown in the
charts.
</p>

<p>
Crucially, it is not implemented for the first occurring strategy,
because the current implementation gives now way to easily keep track
of the first occurence of a pair in the input corpus.

<p>
For me the project is at a good point to move on to other things but there are some things I would do next otherwise:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Port to Zig. Currently I'm using Zig for some other projects and would be interested in the porting experience and how the performance compares.</li>
<li>Work on different data structures for the input text to support incremental frequency counting for the first strategy.</li>
<li>Optimization of the encode and decode steps.</li>
<li>Implement download and conversion of GPT merges like Karpathy does in his gpt4 code.</li>
<li>Look at implementations of other Tokenization algorithms.</li>
<li>Optimization by parallel computation. At face value it seems possible to do the merge process on multiple cores using a divide and conquer approach. Edge cases where the sections overlap may be tricky.</li>

<p>
I had a lot of pain and a lot of fun working on the code. I highly recommend this kind of process to fully understand the nuances and implementation details required for AI engineering.
</p>

<p>
As a refresher on modern C++ this was a great project. (I recommend (Tour of C++)[<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Tour-C-2nd-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832">https://www.amazon.ca/Tour-C-2nd-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832</a>] and <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the complexity of CMake I found that using C++ today is a pleasant and safe experience as long as you carefully tread the recommended path.
