Working in developer studio, it takes an amount of fiddling and clicking large enough that you may not want to bother.<br /><br />Working in emacs and MingW32 (or Microsoft's CL.exe) I can quickly create a CPP file, and then compile it. To compile a program though you need to either write a makefile, or build up a complex g++ command line. <br /><br />Rather than do either of those I make a helloworld.cpp file which can be built like this: <br /><br />g++ helloworld.cpp -g -o helloworld.exe<br /><br />So I hit <br /><br />M-x compile<br /><br />then type in the above to compile and link it. <br /><br />However there's a better way. You can add the compile command as the first line of the file as a file local variable. <br /><br />// -*- compile-command:"g++ helloworld.cpp -g -o helloworld.exe"; -*-<br /><br />Now I can hit the compile and it works right away, between sessions. No makefile or project settings in sight, and now there are minimal barriers involved in creating a simple test program beyond copy and pasting the file.
