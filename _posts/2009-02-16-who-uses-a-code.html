I often wonder who uses the A* code. Sometimes people write to me to tell me they've used the code in their University assignments or just for fun, but has anyone used this in a project that I don't know about?<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/a-star-algorithm-implementation/">My A* algorithm on google code</a><br /><br />During my time at Activision I worked on a code base that included some code from their game Gun, and was happy to find my code, verbatim included there too! <br /><br />Also, today, I downloaded a 2d game prototyping engine called Angel, from some EA guys. When I looked at how their path finding worked, I was surprised to see my code in there too! <br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/angel-engine/">http://code.google.com/p/angel-engine/</a><br /><br />It's cool that people are using this code. If you do use it in some commercial or interesting project, please let me know. A credit or thank you in your product would be nice too!
