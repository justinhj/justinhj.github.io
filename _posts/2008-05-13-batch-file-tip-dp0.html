Here's a nice blog post on this...<br /><br /><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lorenh/archive/2006/03/24/441004.aspx">Silly batch file tricks, redirecting stdout into an evironment variable and %~dp0</a><br /><br />But just for my own reference the cryptic looking character sequence resolves to the path to the batchfile you are running. <br /><br />So if you put the following in a batch file, no matter what directory you are in when you run it, it will print the directory the batch file is in, and do a directory listing.<br /><br /><pre><br />echo Batch file path is %~dp0<br />dir %~dp0<br /></pre>
