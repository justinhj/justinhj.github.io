It's handy in emacs to be able to go straight to your browser to view a page, and you can do fancy stuff with `webjump' as I mentioned in a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2009-05-07-emacs-searching-programming-apis-with %}">previous post</a>.<br /><br /><div>Another handy function is `browse-url' which will prompt for the url but default to whatever your point is at. </div><div><br /></div><div>If you're in a html file and you'd like to open that with your browser then `browse-url-of-file' will open it up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, and I just found this today, if you have some html code in a buffer that isn't even a file, you can open that in your browser to using `browse-url-of-buffer' and emacs will write it to a temporary file and open that in the browser for you. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
