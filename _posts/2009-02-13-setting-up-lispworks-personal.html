I've always used this excellent pair of blog posts by Bill Clementson to get lispworks personal working with emacs/slime on windows. <br /><br /><a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/040306.html">Configuring SLIME for 3 Win32 CL Implementations</a><br /><a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/040315.html">Using LispWorks Personal with Emacs/SLIME on Windows</a><br /><br />Having had the joy of a hard drive failure last week I had to reinstall everything, and I've found that with the latest CVS version of slime you need to change your ".slime.lisp" file to look like this:<br /><br /><pre><br />(load "/YOURPATHTOSLIME/slime/swank-loader.lisp")<br />(swank-loader:init)<br />(swank::create-server :port 4005)<br /></pre><br /><br />So if your slime/lispworks personal setup stops working when you upgrade slime, hopefully you found your way here.
