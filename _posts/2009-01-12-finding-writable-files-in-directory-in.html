Simple thing, but if you want to find which files in a directory are writable, use this dos command ...<br /><br /><blockquote><br />dir /a-r-d /s /b<br /></blockquote><br /><br />/a is to search for attributes. In this case r is read only and d is directory. The minus signs negate those attributes. So we're looking for writable files only. <br /><br />/s means recurse subdirectories<br /><br />/b means bare format. Path and filename only.
