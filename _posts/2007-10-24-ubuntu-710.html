With a new version of Ubuntu out (7.10) I decided to repeat the painful experience I put myself through every couple of years to see if I want to use it as a windows replacement on the desktop.<br /><br />I've been pleasantly surprised this time. The install process was a bit of a monumental fuck up, but it turned out that my PC has been overheating for a while due to a dirty fan. Windows didn't seem to care. Linux kept shutting down, and I eventually found the system log that told me why it was shutting down, and the exact temperature that caused it. Nice.<br /><br />At least when linux fails it is usually able to tell you exactly whats going on.<br />Installing the Nvidia drivers turned out to be a pain in the ass too. The simple procedure they give you to do it from the desktop just didn't work. I then tried Nvidia's simple shell script, which didn't work. And a day or so later I found something called Envy, which did work.<br /><br />Overall I had to be familiar with linux commands, logging in as root, and editing configuration scripts to get it to do what I needed. It's still a computer experts OS as far as I can tell. Although you can pay for phone support, I don't think they're anywhere near capturing the typical Best Buy PC owner.<br /><br />So far I can do nearly everything I need to in XP, but the user interface is both flashier, faster, and has the benefit of being linux.<br /><br />It's still likely I won't be able to fully ditch XP though. I can't chat with my webcam yet. The webcam works but  the chat software doesn't support it.<br /><br />I don't like the fonts, but I'm hoping I can configure that, I haven't spent time twiddling with it yet.<br /><br />Ubuntu is definitely getting there.
