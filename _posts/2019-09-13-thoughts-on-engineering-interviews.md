This year I spent some time looking for a new job. I wasn't sure if I wanted to apply work at one of the big tech companies, where I could enjoy some long term stability with plenty of opportunity to work at massive scale. At the same time, I would have to deal with the sometimes impersonal nature of large corporate hierarchies, where making progress on even small changes can take weeks or months. On the other hand my last few jobs have been at smaller startups where you get the advantage of making a huge technical impact, being able to build a small cohesive engineering team that can all mentor each other and grow with the company. The downside is that many startups fail, it's hard to pick one that is on a longterm trajectory of success.

Rather than make the choice myself I thought I would try out a few different applications and see how the chips fell. Here are some notes on that experience.

I thought I'd start big so I repled to an Amazon recruiter that I would be interested in their hiring event. What I expected a hiring event to look like was to see some recruiters and engineers show up to eat snacks and chat about opportunities before swapping business cards and resumes. In fact what it meant was that the recruiter was gathering resumes for a particular role on a particular team. This was not communicated to me until I got further down the process. The first step was a casual call with the recruiter which was followed by a timed online test. The test involved solving two programming problems, one of which was very straightforward and the second a little more involved but there was plenty of time to complete it. After this stage I was now booked for the hiring event which was something like 6 weeks in the future, and given a copy of the Cracking the Code Interview book along with a bunch of information on Amazon's corporate culture and leadership principals. The hiring event consisted of 4 50 minute long interviews. During the interviews the conversation is somewhay
