I've been busy on my emacs redis client <a href="http://code.google.com/p/eredis/">eredis</a> and it now supports the entire API. It still needs a bit more polish but it should be a workable Redis client now, and I will continue to play with the org-mode table integration which I think has a lot of potential uses: for example making a gui to edit server parameters in just a few seconds. <div><br /></div><div>Also made a new video showing some of the new org table creating commands and the monitor mode that shows the Redis commands as they are run on the server:</div><div><br /></div><div><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zm9obhWkTdE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br /></div>
