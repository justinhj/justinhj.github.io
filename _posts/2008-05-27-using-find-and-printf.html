This is basic stuff but I wanted to post it so I can find it when I search for it...<br /><br />How to find a file and print the name, path and date and time it was last accessed...<br /><br />Change filename to be the file you want, with optional wildcards. (Use -iname for case insensitive search).<br /><br /><pre><br />find . -name <filename> -printf "%p %AD %AH:%AM\n"<br /></pre>
