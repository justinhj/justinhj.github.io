One thing I sometimes miss about the text editor Brief, which I stopped using a decade ago, is being able to move between windows easily by pressing a function key and then an arrow key to switch to a window in that direction.<br /><br />In emacs I only knew how to move between windows using `other-window', mapped to <span style="font-style: italic;">C-x o </span>and that only cycles around the windows, and if you have a few windows open and possibly you're also editing the mini-buffer, that's quite a round trip.<br /><br />I just learned about `M-x windmove-default-keybindings', which binds a set of commands that do exactly the kind of directional movement I'm talking about (`windmove-right', `windmove-up' and so on) to the cursor keys (with shift key held).
