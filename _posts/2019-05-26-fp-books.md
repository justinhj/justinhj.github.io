## Scala and Pure FP

Scala supports imperative and object-oriented programming and can be used as a Java with more succinct syntax, type inference and so on. But it also has good support for pure functional programming: that includes good support for working with immutable data, immutable data structures in the standard library, anonymous functions and functions as objects. We can also use features like traits and higher kinded types to build our pure functional programs in a similar way to those using Haskell. 

Now, although Scala does enable us to write in a pure functional style, it is left as an exercise to the programmer. We must learn how to build our code from pure functions, how to be careful not to use mutable data and code with side-effects. Happily, there are great programming libraries out there, like Cats and Scalaz, that provide us with the tools to build our programs in a principiled way. However, those libraries require us to understand a lot of advanced concepts and the learning curve can be steep. Increasingly they have good documentation that is aimed at beginners, but to really make progress it is best to work through one or more of the great Scala functional programming books. In this post I will tell you what to expect from each and how to get the best out of them.

## Functional Programming in Scala

Author(s): Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason
Published: 2014
Publisher: Manning 

Also known as the red book for obvious reasons, this book has a great foreward by Scala creator Martin Odersky. Taking you by the hand the authors walk you through what likely mirrors their own experiences as they worked to find useful pure functional techniques in Scala back before anybody else was doing it. The tone is one of self driven discovery, which inspires the reader that you can learn this stuff, you just have to take it at your own pace, work through the exercises and conduct your own experiments.

The book is structured in three parts. Part one
