On linux machines I search files using find, egrep and xargs as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp; find . -name "*.cpp" | xargs -i egrep -iHn "some search string" {}<br /><br />this outputs any matches with the filename and number and also disables case dependency.<br /><br />On my Mac it doesn't work. I tried reverting to egrep -r (to search recursively) instead, but that doesn't work. It just fails silently too. I tried installing findutils with brew to see if that helped, as often gnu tools are more up to date in brew than in the Apple version, but that didn't help.<br /><br />So after some fiddling I found that the syntax below works:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; find . -name "*.cpp" | xargs egrep -iHn "some search string"<br /><br />Only subtly different!<br /><br />Actually, hold up, this does not work for filenames that have spaces in them. :(<br /><br />Try this instead:<br /><br />find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 egrep -iHn "some search string"<br /><br />J.<br /><div><br /></div>
