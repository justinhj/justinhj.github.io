<h2 id="orga816b2d">What's ZIO Prelude</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga816b2d">
<p>
Recently, ZIO creators, John De Goes and Adam Fraser, presented their
latest functional programming library to the world. ZIO Prelude,
hereafter referred to as Prelude, is promised as a radical shift in
the way functional programming is taught, implemented and used. The
event was the online edition of the SF Scala meetup, and the talk is
now available on YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/OwmHgL9F_9Q">SF Scala: Reimagining Functional Type
Classes</a>. You can also visit the source code on Github <a href="https://github.com/zio/zio-prelude">zio-prelude</a>.
</p>

<p>
For those that don't know, Prelude was initially developed, I'm told, as part of
John De Goes's "Spartan" training program, so I wasn't able to follow it since
its inception. I've been looking forward to the release since I heard about it,
especially since John has alluded to a new type class encoding for a few years,
for example in this talk at flatMap Oslo 2018
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFGnFKMSmL0&amp;t=1462s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFGnFKMSmL0&amp;t=1462s</a>
</p>

<p>
In this post I will give my first impressions, having watched the talk and spent
a few hours playing around with the library. At this stage, the nascent library
is still undergoing rapid changes, so some of what I write here will likely be
outdated fairly soon. I'm also new to the library, so if I make any mistakes
feel free to contact me and I will correct them.

<p>
Prior to the talk John tweeted:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For a decade, 'ap' from Applicative has infected Scala code:
</p>

<p>
def ap[A, B](f: F[A =&gt; B], fa: F[A]): F[B]
</p>

<p>
Cryptic &amp; confusing, did you know the raison d'être of 'ap' is Haskell's curried functions, not category theory?
</p>

<p>
Learn how we can do better! - John De Goes
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This also piqued my curiosity as I have talked about Applicative publicly quite
a bit this year including at online meetups and the Scala Love conference. I
also wrote a lengthy blog post on Applicative Programming with Effects.
</p>

<a href="/2020/04/04/whats-ap.html">What's Ap?</a>

<p>
John has pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/afor0h/scalaz_8_timeline/eeac71m/">before</a> that Ap is not a great ergonomic fit for Scala
(currying is much more natural in Haskell). Ap is hard to teach because of this;
a lot of Scala developers find currying tricky. It is, however, an important
part of the language, and a useful tool for every Scala programmers toolbox.

</ul>

<p>
Later in the post, I will try to reimplement some of my sample code from the
What's Ap post, and see how well Prelude replaces Applicative, both from the
developer perspective and in terms of how easy each would be to teach.
</p>

<p>
From this point of view I will be approaching Prelude in a way that it is not
designed for; mapping the Haskell style class hierarchy to Prelude. We shouldn't
judge it on that basis, but since John threw down the gauntlet I will accept the
challenge to defend my friend the Applicative.

<h2 id="org834b5c7">Goals of Prelude</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org834b5c7">
<p>
As you'll see in the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jdegoes/refactoring-functional-type-classes">slide deck</a>, the goals of prelude are to be the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Radical</li>
<li>Orthogonal</li>
<li>Principled</li>
<li>Scala-First</li>
<li>Minimal</li>
<li>Pragmatic</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Opinionated</li>
</ul>

<p>
The goals I find most compelling here are accessible and orthogonal. As a
functional programming advocate and educator, I am very interested in any steps
towards greater accessibility. The orthogonal part is also key, as I believe
that composability is one of the biggest wins of pure functional programs.

<h2 id="org04a3aca">Algebras, not Category Theory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04a3aca">
<p>
With Cats, almost all of the concepts come from category theory. We have Monads,
Functors, Monoids, Monoidal Functors and so on. The idea with prelude is that
algebra is more familiar to us, as non-mathematician programmers than category
theory. Algebras are also more composable, so the idea is to start with a small
number of primitive things(?) and combining them into more powerful objects.
</p>

<p>
The big question that prelude puts out there is this; is Category Theory an
obstacle to adoption of pure functional programming, and would abstract algebra
be a better way to both introduce newcomers, and provide a better solution
overall to the problems and applications that Cats et al already address?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8fdfc10">
<p>
In my original post, I introduce Functor and Monad as the gateway to
Applicative. Functor is a simple and beautiful thing, in that it allows us to
combine pure functions with "effectful" computations, mapping an F[A] to an
F[B]. In prelude Functor and Monad do not exist as first-class entities,
although we can see them defined as type aliases. This seems to be more
documentation than practical as the type aliases are not used anywhere in the
code.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
In Cats the Functor type class is short for Covariant Functor. What does that
mean? First of all one of the best discussions of covariance in Scala I know can
be found here on the scala-lang.org site:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/variances.html">https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/variances.html</a>
</p>

<p>
In essence, a covariant type parameter, for example with List[+A], means that you
if B is a subtype of A, then List[B] is a subtype of List[A].
</p>

<p>
The Cats Functor is also covariant in that if you have a function that can map
an A to a B, you can map a higher-kinded type F[A] to F[B] too using the
Covariant Functor.
</p>

<p>
In Cats a Functor is defined as a higher-kinded type with a map function. In
Prelude a Functor is just something that implements the Covariant type and
follows its laws.
</p>

<p>
Functor has essentially changed names in Prelude, it is on the surface the same as
the Cats Functor.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala"><span style="color: #00bcff;">List</span>(<span style="color: #00bcff;">1</span>,<span style="color: #00bcff;">2</span>,<span style="color: #00bcff;">3</span>).map(a <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=&gt;</span> a + <span style="color: #00bcff;">1</span>)

</div>

<p>
There is an excellent post about variance and functors on the Typelevel site:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://typelevel.org/blog/2016/02/04/variance-and-functors.html">https://typelevel.org/blog/2016/02/04/variance-and-functors.html</a>
</p>

<p>
You can take a look at the implementation of Covariant here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zio/zio-prelude/blob/master/src/main/scala/zio/prelude/Covariant.scala">https://github.com/zio/zio-prelude/blob/master/src/main/scala/zio/prelude/Covariant.scala</a>
</p>

<p>
It's nice that each abstraction, or algebra, has it's own file, and in that file
you'll find the following.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A trait defining the interface to the algebra. For example, Covariant defines
map and a couple of other functions. In this respect it is similar to Cats.</li>
<li>Laws. The companion object contains the laws to test the algebra directly.
Each object has a <code>laws</code> member that can be checked with the package objects
<code>checkAllLaws</code> method.</li>
<li>Instances. Rather than have instances in a separate file or package, they are
also embedded in the companion. It's nice to have them all easily listed in
the same place. Most algebras have instances for some appropriate standard
library types, as well as some "ZIO" types like <code>ZIO</code> itself and <code>Chunk</code> and
new Prelude types like <code>ZPure</code> which we will get into in a later post.
Another thing I like is the code documentation is laid out like this
<code>`Covariant` instance for `Chunk`</code> so that if you want to find, say, all the
instances for ZIO you can do do a global text search for <code>instance for `ZIO`</code>
and you'll find them. This kind of thoughtful ergonomics is much appreciated.</li>
<li>Finally, at the end of the object implememtation you will find some syntax.
If you ever struggled with imports in Scalaz and Cats, you may appreciate
this one file per algebra layout.</li>

<h3 id="org4ca1745">Monads</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ca1745">
<p>
In Cats we extend Functor with Applicative and add the <code>flatMap</code> operation to get
Monad. Applicative brings us both <code>ap</code> and <code>pure</code>. Leaving ap aside for the
moment, pure is the important ability to lift a pure value into the context of
some effect, represented as a higher-kinded type.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at sequencing two Futures together using prelude. In
order to do that with Cats we would use the Monad flatmap operation.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala"><span style="color: #b6a0ff;">def</span> <span style="color: #feacd0;">getUser</span>(email<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">String</span>)<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">Future</span>[<span style="color: #00bcff;">User</span>] <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=</span> ???

  .flatMap(user <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=&gt;</span> getAccountStatus(user.accountId))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In prelude you would do the same, since nothing overrides flatMap from ZIO or
the standard library, you can simply call flatMap, but you wouldn't be
exercising the new algebraic components that make up prelude, stay tuned.
</p>

<p>
Remember above that Monad is defined as the composition of IdentityFlatten and
Covariant. We already saw that Covariant is Functor and provides map (remember
that all Monad's are functors).
</p>

<p>
IdentityFlatten is the composition of prelude types Associative, Identity and
Flatten. Flatten is easy it just gives us the ability to flatten an effect from
an <code>F[F[A]]</code> to an <code>F[A]</code>. For example, the somewhat contrived code below
executes a ZIO that is nested inside another, resulting in a <code>ZIO[ZIO[A]]</code>. We
can use the ZIO Flatten instance to flatten and run the effects.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala"><span style="color: #b6a0ff;">import</span> zio.<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">_</span>
<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">val</span> <span style="color: #00d3d0;">runtime</span> <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=</span> <span style="color: #00bcff;">Runtime</span>.default
<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">val</span> <span style="color: #00d3d0;">effect</span> <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=</span> <span style="color: #00bcff;">ZIO</span>{putStrLn(<span style="color: #79a8ff;">"Hello!"</span>); <span style="color: #00bcff;">ZIO</span>.succeed(<span style="color: #00bcff;">10</span>)}
runtime.unsafeRun(effect.flatten)
<span style="color: #a8a8a8;">// </span><span style="color: #a8a8a8;">Hello!</span>
<span style="color: #a8a8a8;">// </span><span style="color: #a8a8a8;">Int = 10</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Whilst most types, including ZIO effects, Future, Option and List all have
flatMap, we <code>could</code> define it in terms of <code>Covariant</code> and <code>IdentityFlatten</code> as follows.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scala"><span style="color: #b6a0ff;">def</span> <span style="color: #feacd0;">flatMap</span>[<span style="color: #00bcff;">F</span>[+<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">_</span>]<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">Covariant</span> <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">IdentityFlatten</span>, <span style="color: #00bcff;">A</span>, <span style="color: #00bcff;">B</span>](fa<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">F</span>[<span style="color: #00bcff;">A</span>])(fab<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">A</span> <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=&gt;</span> <span style="color: #00bcff;">F</span>[<span style="color: #00bcff;">B</span>])<span style="color: #b6a0ff;">:</span> <span style="color: #6ae4b9;">F</span>[<span style="color: #00bcff;">B</span>] <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=</span> {
  fa.map(a <span style="color: #b6a0ff;">=&gt;</span> fab(a)).flatten
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Monad also traditionally defines <code>pure</code>, a way to lift pure values into an effect
context. We can do that with Covariant's <code>map</code> and IdentityFlatten's <code>any</code>.
<code>any</code> summons an effect out of thin air for us, and we can then use map to sneak
our pure value into that effect. Whilst this seems a little tricky, it gives a
bit more flexibility. As Adam Fraser puts it, this "also allows you to express
constraints on the types of values that can be injected through implementing
CovariantSubset instead of Covariant". Subsets were not featured in the
talk and I'll talk about those more in a future post once my understanding is
more solidified.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org976046e">
<p>
In my original post we used the ap function to apply a function to an option
using the ap function. Whilst the purpose of this was to go to explain currying
so we can apply a function to multiple effects, as parameters, here let's just
replicated it with prelude.
</p>

<p>
In prelude the equivalent to Applicative is defined as follows.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</div>

<p>
Covariant should be familiar, it is Functor and gives us map. IdentityBoth is
Identity with AssociativeBoth.
</p>

<p>
Associative both is product from Cats. (product can be implemented with the ap
function from Applicative)
</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
In prelude product is essentialy defined directly as AssociativeBoth which
implements a binary associative operator to combine two effects into an effect
containing a tuple, in other words product.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</div>

<p>
Applicative requires map, ap and pure. We have map from Covariant, the
equivalent of ap using both from AssociativeBoth and pure uses Identity just
like with our Monad example.

In the seminal paper Applicative programming with Effects, the first motivating
example for applicative programming is the sequence function. You have a list of
effects, specifically Haskell IO effects, and you would like to turn them into
an <code>IO[List[A]]</code>. You might recognise this as having the same shape and purpose
as Future.sequence from the Scala standard library. sequence is built with its
more powerful friend traverse.

<p>
In Typelevel Cats, the Traverse typeclass makes this more flexible by allows us
to traverse over any type that is a functor (you can map over it) and foldable
(you can fold it with foldLeft, foldRight and fold).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

}

<p>
What's interesting about Traverse is that it relies on a number of type classes
to build its expressive power. Ultimately our little friend <code>ap</code> is the king pin
of the whole thing, allowing us to combine the effects together as we fold in a
way that is "idiomatic" to the effect type. When we traverse a list of Id for
example (the identity monad) we get map, and when we traverse a list of Const,
we get fold. In other words changing the data type is all we need to make
drastically different programs.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate this in my applicative post, I wrote an implementation of a silly
algorithm called Sleep Sort. Sleep Sort works by waiting an amount of time-based
on the value of the number. Emitting the numbers in this way sorts them
(assuming your scheduler is accurate enough). Let's be clear, this is a stupid
way to sort numbers, but it does represent some real-world needs we have like
being able to run effects in parallel.

<p>
Using Cats we can use Traverse.sequence to flip the List[Zio] to ZIO[List] and
then execute it.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Sadly we find this does not work because wanted all the effects to start at once
and then complete at their alloted times, making the sort work. Instead we'll
see each executed in sequence.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Monadic version

Preparing to say number in 6 seconds
6
Preparing to say number in 5 seconds

// ... and so on for a while
</pre>

<p>
Happily thanks to the joys of Applicative we can fix this by changing the data
type. If we rewrite using Cats Effect we wrap our IO into a different type
called Par.IO which has a different implementation of applicative that does NOT
sequence the IOs together but allows them to run in parallel, we can get the
sleep sort behaviour. We didn't change the structure of our code, just the data
type!
</p>

<p>
Now all of the effects started at the same time and ran in parallel.

<p>
Let's visit the same problem using our ZIO effects above. One thing I really
like about prelude is how combinations of its algebras are mapped to ZIO
effects. In this table we have two ZIO effects <code>fa : ZIO[R, E, A]</code> and <code>fb :
ZIO[R, E, B]</code> that are combined in different ways just by changing the algebra.

</table>

<p>
This is really nice and similar in spirit to what we did with Cats Traverse.
</p>

<p>
ZIO's implementation of Traverse has eschewed conventional names for some
functions in favour or more common words, so for example sequence is just flip,
which describes the flipping of the <code>F[G[A]]</code> to a <code>G[F[A]]</code>. We should be able
to just flip our list of ZIOs and execute them using traverse.
</p>

<p>
However, when we come back to Traverable prelude's (version of Traverse) there
are two difficulties.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org04dd83b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org04dd83b">Problem 1. Traversable doesn't handle empty structures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04dd83b">
<p>
Perhaps by design, you cannot just take a list of ZIO effects and Traverse them,
because the flip function requires the G parameter to have the IdentityBoth
algebra. That algebra lets us combine two effects to a tuple, and there is an
identity element. ZIO effects do not have an instance of the IdentityBoth
algebra and as such cannot be used with Traverable.
</p>

<p>
We can get around this by using the NonEmptyTraversable which implements the
Traversable type class for non-empty structures. Its functions are postfixed
with a 1 to indicate they require at least one element to work with, and use
AssociativeBoth algebra which ZIO has as you can see above.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org302cf8f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org302cf8f">Problem 2. We don't have a way to change from sequenced to parallel execution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org302cf8f">
<p>
When we were dealing with Applicatives we can change the data type to select a
different applicative and get a different combining method. This is a crucial
part of Traverse IMHO. This functionality is missing because the algebra is
hardcoded. We can't used the Algebra of choice from the table above (we would
need to use CommutativeBoth to get the parallel execution the sleep sort needs).

<h3 id="org47e5877">Possible Solutions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org47e5877">
<p>
I talked to Adam Fraser about this and the probable solution will be a
forthcoming newtype called Parallel which can wrap your effects with. This would
work but feels a bit strange because we already had algebras that change
behaviours but we can't freely use them in this context, and having additional
newtypes seems like it violates the don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle.
</p>

<p>
Another possible solution would be to have additional Traverse types with
different algebras. Neither solution seems as clean as the Applicative one at
this point.
</p>

<p>
One advantage of Applicatives is that you can compose any two with each other.
As an advanced example from one of my talks I compose Const, IO and Parallel
together, and take advantage of Monoidal composition, to execute a list of IO
operations and gather statistics on the results as well as collecting the
values.

<h2 id="org705e9a7">Some final defense for ap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org705e9a7">
<p>
Whilst ap is certainly not a perfect for Scala, what it does have going for it
from a pedagogical point of view is that you can teach Functor, Monad and
Applicative as being three ways to map a <code>F[A] =&gt; F[B]</code>. The only difference
between them is the "shape" of the function you use to do the mapping. With
functor the pure function <code>A =&gt; B</code> defines the Functor as letting us run a pure
function on an effect. With flatMap the function <code>A =&gt; F[B]</code> lets us compose two
effects together, with the result of one passed to the second. And finally, with
Applicative, the <code>F[A =&gt; B]</code> function is the building block for running two
independent effects together.
</p>

<p>
With that out of the way, and with the student sufficiently guided through the
process of currying and the implementation of map2, map3 etc, we can move on
from ap and maybe never look at it again. Applicative is still applicative
whether you formulate it with <code>pure</code> and <code>ap</code>, with <code>product</code>, or with <code>map2</code>.
You can enjoy the benefits of Applicative without adopting the red-headed
stepchild we call <code>ap</code>.

<h2 id="org8d6603c">Things I missed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8d6603c">
<p>
I intend to write more on Prelude soon, but until I do here the bits I didn't
mention that are nevertheless very interesting features.
</p>

<p>
Variance. If you tend to ignore variance in your Scala that will likely change
in Prelude. I tend to stick to invariant types a lot of the time, but Prelude's
design encourages call site variance, and we should start to see interesting
examples of what that empowers us to do more of. In the talk John's example was
that he wanted to map an A to B but have more control over what the B is;
perhaps it is a Spark serializable type&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
ZPure. When ZIO came along it brought the idea of getting rid of stacks of Monad
transformers by putting all that functionality (error channels, read-only
environments) into an effect. With ZPure we get to do a similar thing for none
IO effects. ZPure gives you a State monad, a read only environment. I expect
ZPure will be an important building block for ZIO and Prelude code, and I'm
looking forward to playing with it some more.
</p>

<p>
Newtypes. Prelude comes With a nice newtype implementation. I haven't looked
into it much, but it seems to work quite well with minimal effort.

<h2 id="orgda4659c">Wrapping things up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgda4659c">
<p>
As zio-prelude evolves I expect it will at first grow, then shed some features
into modules or libraries, before shrinking to a smaller but coherent core.
</p>

<p>
At this point I believe Prelude is a very interesting new addition to the Scala
functional programming library ecosystem. Those experienced with the
Haskell-like way of doing things will probably find its way of doing things
pretty strange at first, and I don't know how long that feeling will last.
</p>

<p>
Another question is whether functional programming in Scala will further
bifurcate. As Prelude and ZIO become more closely intertwined (they already
depend on each other), I expect that some people will be put off by the novelty
of Prelude and stick with the Cats ecosystem, while others will avoid things
built on Cats in order to stay in the ZIO and Prelude world.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately time will tell whether Prelude's approach will make a big impact on
Scala functional programming. In any event the best ideas will live on.
