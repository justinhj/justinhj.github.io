It's been a while since I've written a blog post about Scala. Partly because a lot of my side projects and self learning have been focused on both understanding new developments in generative AI and how to use it, as well as learning a new language for system level code, <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. However, I have a few latent posts and videos that I would like to wrap up, in particular the <a href="https://github.com/functionaljustin/duct">Duct</a> category theory style Scala library is not really complete without an IO/Effect data type, nor some capability for streaming.
</p>

<p>
I plan to work towards an effect type in Duct, but first I thought it would be fun to review the history of effects in Scala which looks something like this:
</p>

<td class="org-left">First major functional IO/Task for Scala.</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>

<td class="org-left">Monix Task</td>
<td class="org-right">2016</td>
<td class="org-left">Added cancellation, fine-grained control, and high performance.</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Cats Effect</td>
<td class="org-right">2017</td>
<td class="org-left">Standardized the ecosystem with a shared IO and Typeclasses.</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Zio</td>
<td class="org-right">2018</td>
<td class="org-left">Introduced the "Environment" (R), typed errors (E)</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
All these effects have different design goals and scope, so it is instructive to start at the beginning and see how effects evolved over time. In this post I will use the word effect to mean a potentially lazily evaluated computation. This is where Scala Effects diverge from Scala's standard library future, which can only represent eagerly evaluated computation.
</p>

<p>
Before looking in detail at ScalaZ task which requires a post of its own, let's explore the mechanism by which you can execute code on a thread, which is a fundamental capability for effect systems. 
</p>

<p>
A great source for this can be found in the "purely functional parallelism" chapter of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala">Functional Programming in Scala</a>. In this post I will dig into that chapter as I think it's a great foundation to build on for a series about effect types in general.
