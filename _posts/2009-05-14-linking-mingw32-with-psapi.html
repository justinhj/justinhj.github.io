Here's something I came across that didn't have a good answer when I googled. If you get link errors with MingW32 like:<br /><br />undefined reference to `GetProcessMemoryInfo@12' or <br />c:/justinhj/mem.cpp:55: undefined reference to `EnumProcesses@12'<br /><br />Then you are not linking with the library psapi, and you need it. <br /><br />To do this just add -lpsapi to your command line. It needs to be last in the list of libraries too!
