Since then I've become a total Mac-head. Here's an update on how you get that working from emacs on a mac... <div><br /></div><div>Everything is the same except you need to install Growl for Mac (obv) and also make sure you copy the folder called Extras somewhere. </div><div><br /></div><div>Open up a terminal and then cd to where you put the Extras directory. Find a sub-directory called growlnotify. Enter that and run 'sudo ./install.sh' which will prompt you for your admin password, and then go ahead and install <a href="http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify">growlnotify</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can now run growlnotify from a terminal window. Try it out, if it doesn't work you won't be able to growl from emacs.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now follow the instructions in my blog post above but ignore all the windows parts. You'll need to customize the growl command (M-x customize group, todochiku) and replace the full path I used for windows with just 'growlnotify'.</div><div><br /></div><div>If everything is cool you can now do M-x todochiku-in and type a message, a time in minutes (zero for now), and pop, you should have a notification.</div>
