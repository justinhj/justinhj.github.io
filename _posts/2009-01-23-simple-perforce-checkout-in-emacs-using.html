I know there are all kinds of clever perforce modes, but I prefer to have a few common perforce actions that I write myself and can easily extend and customise as needed.<br /><br />For example this is all you need to checkout a file you are visiting.<br /><br /><pre><br />(defun p4-checkout-buffer()<br /> "Check out the current buffer from perforce using a shell command line"<br /> (interactive)<br /> (shell-command (format "p4.exe edit %s" (buffer-file-name)))<br /> (toggle-read-only -1))<br /></pre>
