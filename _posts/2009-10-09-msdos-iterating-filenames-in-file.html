<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: 800;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'lucida grande';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><div>In an earlier post I covered finding the writable files in a directory, which is something you often need to do when messing around with source control. For example, if there's a writable file in your source folder that isn't checked out, then you know you need to add it before checking in. In fact I have a tool that compares my changelist with the list of writable files, and lets me know if I'm about to break the build when I check in.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway I digress. Once you have found the writable files using:</div><div><br /></div><div><b>dir source_folder /a-r-d /s /b > files.txt </b></div><div><br /></div><div>then you may want to run some operation on them; for example make them read only.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's how to do that with the windows for command (see here for documentation)</div><div><br /></div><div><b>for /F %i in (files.txt) do attrib -R %i</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The for command with the /F option can iterate through a file full of filenames, which is what we generated with the first command, and run the operation after the do instruction.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's actually quite powerful; you can specify comment markers, delimiters, and choose which of a number of columns you want to make into variables.</div><div><br /></div></span></span></span></div>
