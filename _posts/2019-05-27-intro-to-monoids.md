# Monoids

In Scala, when practising pure functional programming, we borrow ideas from mathematics in order to describe algebraic relationships. It's a source of fear and/or confusion that words like Monad, Monoid, Functor and Applicative show up in relatively simple Scala programs. 

However, once you put aside the unfamiliar words, these things are not only quite simple, but they give our programs a principled theoretic grounding. Just like when we extend our vocabulary, we can communicate our ideas with more precision and more conscisely to boot.
