  <h1>Presentations and Talks</h1>
  <div class="post-content">
    These talks are aimed at beginner to intermediate Scala programmers that are
    interested in learning more about pure functional programming in Scala. I
    like to present a topic in depth whilst keeping it accessible. Feel free to
    contact me with questions and feedback on any of these talks, or on my

      you from the basics of pure functional programming to an advanced example
      using applicative functors, monoids, traverse, const and parallel IO.

    <h3>Scala Love 2020 - What's Ap?</h3>
    <div class="talk-text">
      In this talk find out about three mapping functions map, flatMap and
      the lesser known ap. For each one we will learn what we can from its type
      signature, see what it does for some common data types and ultimately
      consider what it means from a more theoretical standpoint. We wrap up with
      an example of optimized image processing using the ap function.
