** Introduction
This is a companion blog my sixth Functional Justin YouTube video
which you can find here: https://youtu.be/3GPXEzO14ZE

In the video I talked about the Functor Laws and continued working on
the example program that evaluates arithmetic expressions. I use
Monad, then Applicative, to show how we can make a Numeric instance
for Either, so we can handle errors in a nice functional way.

Since the episode I spent a bit of time cleaning up the code and
putting what we already saw (Numeric and Functor) into their own
packages. I also went ahead and implemented Applicative and Monad
which will be used in the the video and below.

You can find the typeclasses here:

** Functor Laws

Our Functor type class really only exists to implement the map
function, and we already have a map function in the Scala standard
library for such things as Options, Lists and Futures. You might
wonder why we would go the trouble of making our own abstraction just
to write a function that we already had.

The goal of abstractions like Functor is not just to provide useful
functions like map, but to provide a principled layer that we can
build further abstractions upon. For example we will see that
Applicative can be built on top of Functor, Monad on top of
Applicative, and this is only possible because Functor behaves in
accordance to strict rules that it brought with it from Category
Theory.

You can read more about Functors on the Haskell documentation pages:

https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor

Another great resource is the famous "red book"... 

https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala

*** Functors preserve identity morphisms

What this law states is that if we map over some effect with the
identity function, then neither the effect nor any value inside it
will change.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  // Identity law for functors...
  val l1 = List(1, 2, 3)
  assert(l1 == l1.fmap(a => identity(a)))

  val e1: Either[String, Int] = Right(10)
  assert(e1 == e1.fmap(identity))
#+END_SRC

In the two examples we mapped an Either and a List using the identity
function and nothing changed.

*** Functors preserve composition of morphisms 

If we have two functions, f and g, it doesn't matter if we map over
some effect with f first then map over it with g, or we map over it
one time with the composition of f and g. Using the either and list
from above we can show this the case here.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def f(a: Int): Int = a + 1
  def g(a: Int): Int = a - 1

  assert(e1.fmap(f).fmap(g) == e1.fmap(a => g(f(a))))
  assert(l1.fmap(f).fmap(g) == l1.fmap(a => g(f(a))))
#+END_SRC

*** Importing given instances

Note that in Scala pre version 3 if you use a wildcard import ~_~ then
you get all everything exposed in that package. That means you get all
the implicit instances too. It was a source of confusion for beginners
and even experienced Scala programmers to know which file to import
and sometimes to know where instances you are using are defined.

To help with that NO implicits are imported with a regular wildcard
and instead you must import them with the new given syntax.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.justinhj.typeclasses.functor.{given, _}
#+END_SRC

If you want you can also import only specific instances. This, in my
opinon, will make things a lot simpler and more precise.

One caveat here is that the given wildcard must appear before the
underscore wildcard.

** Implementing Numeric for Either

** Functor isn't enough

The following code implements an arithmetic expression evaluator using
the Numeric type class developed in a previous video and adds error
handling by using Either. Each step of our evaluator has this signature.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  type WithEnv[A] = Env[A] ?=> Either[EvalError, A]
#+END_SRC

Which means it is a function takes an input environment (our symbol
table) as an implicit argument, and returns an Either where the error
(or Left) type is EvalError. EvalError represents the different errors
our code will handle. It is a sum type implemented as a Scala 3 enum
(seen in a previous video).

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
enum EvalError {
  case InvalidSymboName
  case SymbolNotFound
}
#+END_SRC

In previous blogs/videos I showed how we can implement a Numeric
instance so we can do arithmetic on many different types, just so long
as we create an instance of Numeric to handle them. Now we must
implement Numeric for the following type ~Numeric[Either[EvalError, A]]~.

The instance signature is

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  given evalResultNumeric[A: Numeric]: Numeric[Either[EvalError, A]] with {
#+END_SRC

Now we must implement the methods of Numeric. Because our numeric
values are inside the EvalResult (an Either) we can't just implement
the multiply directly. We need a way to get inside it. As we saw in
the previous blog/video, Functor gives us a way to apply a pure
function to an effect. Since mul is a pure function, maybe we can use
it?

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def mul(a: EvalResult[A], b: EvalResult[A]): EvalResult[A] = {
  a.fmap { // DOES NOT COMPILE, WRONG TYPE
    aa => 
    b.fmap {
      bb =>
        aa * bb
    }
  }
}
#+END_SRC

Note I am using the name fmap and fflatMap to make it clear we are not
using the standard library implementations here. This is just for
clarity but is not a good practise because, for example, you will lose
the ability to use for comprehensions.

What went wrong here is that Functor's map operation has the signature

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  extension [A, B](x: F[A])
    def ffmap(f: A => B): F[B]
#+END_SRC


which means it takes our ~Either[EvalError, Numeric[A]]~ and a pure
function, which it will apply to the Numeric. Unfortunately we end up
with an extra layer of Either! Let's see why...

** Monad to the rescue

So instead of Functor with its map function, we need Monad and its
flatMap which let's us implement all the arithmetic functions in a
straightforward manner.

https://github.com/justinhj/evalexample/blob/video6/src/main/scala/org/justinhj/typeclasses/monad/Monad.scala

I've implemented Monad in the file above and made it available to the
code. The implementation is simple and based on the example given in
the Dotty documentation. The main difference is I've also implemented
Applicative, since we will use that in a moment, and Monad extends
Applicative.

https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/type-classes.html

Now each arithmetic operator can be implemented as follows, which
achieves our goal of being principled and functional and let's us
handle errors at the type level.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def mul(a: EvalResult[A], b: EvalResult[A]): EvalResult[A] = {
  a.fflatMap {
    aa => 
      b.map {
        bb =>
          aa * bb
      }
  }
}
#+END_SRC

*** Map2 we love you

Unfortunately it's bit verbose. Monad is more powerful than we need in
fact. We could use Applicative instead. I will talk more about Monad
and Applicative in a later video, but in short you can think of Monads
as being good for putting two effects together and flattening the
result, whilst Applicative is good for passing multiple effect values
as parameters to some pure function.

You can see the Applicative implementation here. 

https://github.com/justinhj/evalexample/blob/video6/src/main/scala/org/justinhj/typeclasses/applicative/Applicative

Now, Functor has map, Monad has flatMap and Applicative has its own
mapping function called ap. Whilst it's out of scope for right now,
the ap mapping function makes it possible to apply two or more effects
as parameters to a pure function, which is exactly what we need
here. From ap you can derive methods that make this much simpler, map2
for example. Here we use map 2 to take any two input effects and apply
the multiply operator to them...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def mul(a: EvalResult[A], b: EvalResult[A]): EvalResult[A] = 
  a.map2(b)((a,b) => a * b)
#+END_SRC

** Division by Zero

What we have at this point is a nice implementation of Numeric that
uses Either's for error handling, which in turn is built on
Applicative. Let's see how easy it is to add new errors and
capabilities to the expression evaluator.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
enum EvalError {
  case InvalidSymboName
  case SymbolNotFound
  case DivisionByZero
}
#+END_SRC

First we add a new error type DivisionByZero. The next thing we need
is for Numeric to have a concept of whether a number is zero or
not. Remember that we can implement Numeric for many different types
and not all of them represent zero the same way. We can therefore add
an isZero predicate to the type class.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def isZero(a: T): Boolean 
#+END_SRC

Next every instance of Numeric needs an implementation of it, so for
exapmle in the Int instance we have the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def isZero(a: Int) = a == 0
#+END_SRC

The implementation for Numeric Either let's us write the isZero for
any value in an either as long as that value has a numeric instance of
its own.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
given evalResultNumeric[A: Numeric]: Numeric[Either[EvalError, A]] with {
  def isZero(a: EvalResult[A]): Boolean = {
    a match {
      case Right(a) if summon[Numeric[A]].isZero(a) => true
      case _ => false
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

Finally we can implement the division operator for Numeric Either like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def div(a: EvalResult[A], b: EvalResult[A]): EvalResult[A] = {
  if isZero(b) then
    Left(EvalError.DivisionByZero)
  else 
    a.map2(b)(_ / _)
}
#+END_SRC
