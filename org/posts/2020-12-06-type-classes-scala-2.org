** Make your own Numeric type class
This is the companion blog for a Functional Justin video which you can
find here https://youtu.be/pJFfXhZlR5o. This is a series of
coffee-break sized videos that each explore a topic in the world of
Scala Functional Programming.

In this video I talk about Type classes and here is the blog version for those that would rather read.

** What are type classes

Here are some good references for reading about type classes in Scala (they can of course be implemented in other functional programming languages).

Sam Halliday has a great introduction to data types and type classes in his book Functional Programming for Mortals.
https://leanpub.com/fpmortals/read#leanpub-auto-data-and-functionality

This idea of separating data from functions can also be found in the Cats functional programming library, with the library itself being organised into distinct sections for data types and type classes.
https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html
https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes

In my own words, type classes are not explicitly part of the Scala
language, but are rather a pattern of implementation that enable you
to define behaviours which can then be implemented for data
types. Data types are values like strings and numbers, collections
like lists and sets and "higher kinded types" like IO, ZIO and so on.

Type classes do not have to be implemented a certain way, but in Cats,
Scalaz and other libraries you will find them implemented just as they
are here, but additional layers of complexity to manage things like
stack safety and take advantage of tools to generate boilerplate code.

In general type classes consist of:

- A trait that has one, or sometimes more, type parameters.
- It contains one or more abstract methods. These define behaviours that must be implemented for each ~instance~.
- Also you will find generalized methods that are built using the abstract ones.
- Typically a type class contains no data

** Numeric

In the video I coded up the Numeric type class. What is Numeric? It is
a type class you'll find in the Scala standard library and is used to
build a generic representation of numbers.

https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/math/Numeric.html

What I develop here is just enough that we can use it for the
expression evaluator in the first video (which only requires add and
multiply operations).

You can find the complete code here

https://github.com/justinhj/evalexample/blob/master/src/main/scala/Scala2Numeric.scala

Let's look at the pieces one by one...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
trait Numeric[T] {
  def Add(a: T, b: T): T
  def Mul(a: T, b: T): T

  def square(a: T): T = mul(a, a)
}
#+END_SRC

Here we define the trait which decribes the core of our type class;
what it can do, and what you need to implement if you want your data
type to be an instance of this typeclass.

Add and Mul are abstract, whilst the square function is derived or
generalized and does not need to be implemented when making new
supported instances.

** Instances

Once you have the interface for your type class you can define instances for various data types. Here we define the instance for =Long=.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit val numericLong: Numeric[Long] = new Numeric[Long] {
  def add(a: Long, b: Long): Long = a + b
  def mul(a: Long, b: Long): Long = a * b
}
#+END_SRC

Note that this is implicit to make it easier to use our instances with
other types, taking advantage of the fact that users can import the
definititions and then use them in their code.

Here's an example function that is written using the Numeric type
class as a parameter. This function displays what we call =ad-hoc
polymorphism=, in that this function does not know all of the
instances that exist for the input type =T=, nor does it need to. All
it knows is that to do its work it needs an instance of =Numeric[T]=
so that it can access the =add= method.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def sumList[T](ts: List[T])(implicit numeric: Numeric[T]): T = {
  ts.reduce((a, b) => numeric.Add(a,b))
}
#+END_SRC

Now we can sum a list of any =T= where T has a Numeric instance. Here we use the Int instance (not shown).

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val l1 = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
val sum = sumList(l1)

println(s"sum of int list is $sum")
// sum of int list is 10
#+END_SRC

** Improving the ergonomics

So that's all you need to build type classes but we can take a couple
of steps to make things more ergonomic. For one we can ditch the
implicit parameter and instead make use of
[[https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/FAQ/context-bounds.html]context
bounds]]. This makes things clearer for the caller of the function.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def sumList[T : Numeric](ts: List[T]): T = {
  val numeric = implicitly[Numeric[T]]
  ts.reduce((a, b) => numeric.add(a,b))
}
#+END_SRC

Note that we have to ~summon~ the implicit Numeric instance using
=implicitly=. This is a function in the standard library which takes
advantage of the way context bounds work: the context bound ~Numeric~
specifies that there is an implicit Numeric instance in scope, but
there is no named parameter as before. The implicitly function lets
us access that implicit in a succinct way.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def implicitly[T](implicit e: T): T = e
#+END_SRC

So using context bounds helps a little with the use of type classes,
the next step is to use implicit conversions so that we take the
functions in our type class and make them look like ordinary methods
on the data type.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
object ops {

  implicit class NumericOps[T](a: T)(implicit numeric: Numeric[T]) {
    def add(b: T): T = numeric.add(a, b)
    def mul(b: T): T = numeric.mul(a, b)

    def +(b: T): T = add(b)
    def *(b: T): T = mul(b)
  }

}
#+END_SRC

Now if we import ops we can take advantage of the implicit conversion from type T to type NumericOps[T] to give us syntax like below.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val s1 = "abcd"
val s2 = "efgh"
val product = s1 * s2
println(s"product $product")
// product aeafagahbebfbgbhcecfcgchdedfdgdh
#+END_SRC

So you can see that by implementing a somewhat goofy instance of
Numeric for string (given below) we now have the ability to use the
multiplication operator on it as if it was a regular number.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit val stringNumeric: Numeric[String] = new Numeric[String] {
    def add(a: String, b: String): String = a + b

    def mul(a: String, b: String): String = for (
      as <- a;
      bs <- b;
      s <- as.toString ++ bs.toString) yield s
  }
#+END_SRC

Note that while this implentation of string arithmetic is not very
rigorous and just for fun, there's nothing to stop you from
implementing Numeric for data types that do have well defined
arithmetic operations such as Roman Numerals.

** Coherence

Type class coherence is an important concept I'll leave you with. This
is a guideline in place to keep programs easy to reason about. It's a
good practice to keep common instances together with your type classes
so that users can easily find them, and don't duplicate the work. It's
also important that you don't try to make multiple instances and let
the users select one depending on their needs. The reason for that is
the behaviour of your program can change profoundly when you do this,
and that's terrible. It means you can't take advantage of ~local
reasoning~, one of the benefits of functional programming. You would
need to be very careful with imports to make sure you are using the
instance you think you are.

** Final words

If you're coming from Java or similar OOP language you may recognise
some of this as the adapter pattern (except with Scala
implicits). Type class traits also have similarities to Go interfaces,
although the type class pattern goes a bit beyond them in scope.

I would be amiss not to mention Haskell here, which has type classes
implemented as a first-class language construct, and for some people
the over-use of type classes in Scala is somewhat of an
anti-pattern. We will see in future videos that the pattern will be
greatly simplified in Scala 3 however.
