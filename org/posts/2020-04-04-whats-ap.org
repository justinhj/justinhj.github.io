** Introduction
This post is aimed at the Scala programmer who is familiar with the basics of
the language and ideally becoming interested, or already deeply entrenched, in
pure functional programming and curious about ~Applicative Functors~. We'll
delve into the original paper in which they were introduced, converting the
Haskell code to modern Scala, both custom code and using Cats, Cats Effect and
Zio. Finally, we'll look at an efficient implementation of blending two images
using Applicative programming.
** Functor and Monad
As a Scala programmer, you will be no doubt be familiar with the ~map~ and
~flatMap~ functions, which you will find in some of the collections and other
data types in the standard Scala library. If you're interested in pure
functional programming, and have used the Cats or Scalaz libraries, you may know
that these two functions are part of the ~Functor~ and ~Monad~ type classes
respectively.

Before looking at ~Apply~ and ~Applicative~ let's review what you can do
Functors and Monads.

Remember, the goal of functional programming is to do most of our work using
pure functions. We use structures like Functors and Monads to manage effects
(things that are not pure); letting us use pure functions in an effectful world.
The Functor type class gives us the power to take a pure function like ~a => a +
1~ and apply it to the value inside an effect. Here are a couple of examples of
using Functor's map on two data types...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
List(1,2,3).map(a => a + 1)
// res: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)

Option(1).map(a => a + 1)
// res: Option[Int] = Some(2)
#+END_SRC

Functor gives you the ability to reach inside an effect, apply a pure
function to the value inside there, and wrap it up inside an effect of the same
type. The type signature of map is ~map[A,B](fa: F[A], f: A => B): F[B]~.

Monad instances have two functions. The first, ~pure~ or ~unit~, gives us a way
to lift pure values into an effectful context. ~pure[A](a: A) F[A]~ and you can
think of it as being a type constructor...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import cats._
import cats.implicits._

1.pure[List]
// res: List[Int] = List(1)

1.pure[Option]
// res: Option[Int] = Some(1)
#+END_SRC

Pure isn't really giving us something we didn't already have; we could make a
list and an option before. But the pure function is useful as a building block
when building code that uses Monad instances. We'll see it in use later.

Finally, Monad has the ~flatMap~ function. The signature is ~flatMap[A,B](fa:
F[A], f: A => [B]): F[B]~. flatMap comes in handy when we compose two effects
together. It let's you get the result from the first and pass it as a (pure) parameter
to the next. For example, imagine we have two calls that go out over the network
to a database or external service and we use map to chain them together...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def getUser(email: String): Future[User] = ???

def getAccountStatus(id: String): Future[AccountStatus] = ???

val accountStatus = getUser("bob@google.com")
  .map(user => getAccountStatus(user.accountId))
// accountStatus has type Future[Future[AccountStatus]]
#+END_SRC

Dealing with nested effects like ~Future[Future[_]]~ creates a burden on us to
reach inside the layers one at a time. If we used flatMap instead it would take
care of flattening the result for us...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val accountStatus = getUser("bob@google.com")
  .flatMap(user => getAccountStatus(user.accountId))
// accountStatus has type Future[AccountStatus]
#+END_SRC

That is the essence of Monads; being able to compose effects together. Note
that the second call is dependent on the first. It would make no sense to call
~getAccountStatus~ before we called ~getUser~ because we need the user's account
ID. In fact, even if these two effects were completely independent, we would
still have to wait for the first one before calling the second. That's not an
ideal situation because these calls may take tens or even a few hundred
milliseconds. If we want the service to be low latency, we would like to run
these calls concurrently instead of in sequence.
** What's Ap?
Now we're caught up Functors and Monads, let's look at the ~Applicative~
typeclass. It is defined as follows in Cats, with some details removed...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
trait Applicative[F[_]] extends Apply[F] {
  def pure[A](x: A): F[A]
}
#+END_SRC

If you make an instance of Applicative then you need to supply an implementation
of ~pure~ which is exactly the same as pure found in Monads. You also need to
implement ~Apply~ which looks like this...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
trait Apply[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
  def ap[A, B](ff: F[A => B])(fa: F[A]): F[B]
}
#+END_SRC

You can see that ~Apply~ extends Functor which means it has map. Also it has the
function ~ap~ which is, of course, the main subject of this post. What a curious
type signature! Just like with ~map~ we are dealing with an effect type ~F~, and
a parameter ~F[A]~. The difference is the function we want to /apply/ (~ff: F[A
=> B]=~) is also /inside the effect/.

Before talking about what this is useful for, let's look at what it actually
does for various implementations.

*** Applicative instance for Option

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
Option((a:Int) => a + 10).ap(Option(20))
// res: Option[Int] = Some(30)

Option((a:Int) => a + 10).ap(None)
// res: Option[Int] = None

Option.empty[Int => Int].ap(Option(20))
// res: Option[Int] = None

Option.empty[Int => Int].ap(Option.empty[Int])
// res: Option[Int] = None
#+END_SRC

The ap function for Option, then, behaves probably as you'd expect. When you
/apply/ the function, if the ~ff~ argument is ~None~ then there's nothing to
apply and we get the result ~None~. If there is a function in there, we extract
it so that we have a /pure function/ that we can /apply/ to the effectful
argument ~F[A]~. Again, if that is empty we get ~None~, otherwise, we get the
value ~f(a)~ which will be wrapped back up in the effect giving ~Some(30)~.

*** Applicative instance for List

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
List((a:Int) => a + 1,
     (a:Int) => a - 10,
     (a:Int) => a + 22).ap(List(1,2,3))
// res: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4, -9, -8, -7, 23, 24, 25)
#+END_SRC

For ~List~ the input value for ~ff~ has the signature ~List[A => B]~, and each
function in the list is applied to each argument in the input list.

*** Idomaticly apply all the things
All data types that have instances of Applicative have a way to apply a
function wrapped in an effect of that type, and the way that it is applied is
/idomatic/ to that effect. In fact, before the name ~Applicative Functor~ stuck,
they were called ~Idioms~.

You may be scratching your head at this point, for it's not often in programming
that you want to apply a list of functions to a list (although I'm sure you can
probably come up with some ways to use it), and how often do you have functions
in Options? It gets weirder in the case of other data types. With ~Future~, or
~IO~, for example, do you ever remember writing a function that returns a
function from a Future? It's certainly rare. Still more strange would be a
function inside a ~State~ monad, but that is perfectly valid too...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import cats.data.State

// Create a function in a State
val fs = State[Int, (Int => Int)]
  (s => (s, (a: Int) => a + s))

// Now to apply it to an appropriate State
val applied = fs.ap(State[Int, Int](s => (s,10)))

// Finally run the Applicative State and grab the value
applied.run(10).value
//res: (Int, Int) = (10, 20)
#+END_SRC

I don't think you can get the answer to "What's Ap" just by looking at type
signatures and examples. To really understand applicative style in depth I
thought I would walk through the seminal paper on the subject and get it from
the originators...

** Applicative Programming with Effects
*** Let's Apply ourselves
Applicative Functors first saw the light of day in the 2008 paper by McBride and
Patterson, "Applicative Programming with Effects" which you can find here...

[[https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf]]

The paper begins with three motivating examples for the use of Applicative style...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is the story of a pattern that popped up time and again in our daily work,
programming in Haskell (Peyton Jones, 2003), until the temptation to abstract it
became irresistible. Let us illustrate with some examples.
#+END_QUOTE

We'll walk through each of these examples and convert them to use Scala...

**** Sequencing Commands
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One often wants to execute a sequence of commands and
collect the sequence of their responses, and indeed there is such a function in the
Haskell Prelude (here specialised to IO)
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
sequence :: [IO a ] → IO [a ]
sequence [ ] = return [ ]
sequence (c : cs) = do
  x ← c
  xs ← sequence cs
#+END_SRC

Before we get started, if you're following along in your Scala IDE or REPL you
will need some imports listed below. You can also clone the Github repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import zio._
import zio.console._
import zio.clock._
import zio.duration._
import cats.Applicative
import cats.implicits._
#+END_SRC

... and the following libraries ...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
 "org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % "2.1.1",
 "dev.zio" %% "zio" % "1.0.0-RC18")
#+END_SRC

I am using ZIO in place of Haskell's IO Monad, and bringing in Cats to use its
Applicative.

Converting the sequence function from Haskell to Scala...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def monadicSequence[Z,E,A](ios: List[ZIO[Z, E, A]]): ZIO[Z, E, List[A]] = {
    ios match {
      case Nil =>
        zioApplicative.pure(List.empty[A])
      case c :: cs =>
        for (
          x <- c;
          xs <- monadicSequence(cs)
        ) yield (x +: xs)
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

If you're not familiar with ~ZIO~ you can think of it as a replacement for the standard library
Scala ~Future~, but it has better performance and a lot more features. It is
also not eagerly evaluated like Future. To explain, when you create a future it runs
immediately and you cannot run it again. You can create a ZIO and run it when
you decide to and as many times as you want.

To demonstrate this sequence running let's write an implementation of a silly
algorithm called Sleep Sort. Sleep Sort works by waiting an amount of time based
on the value of the number. Emitting the numbers in this way sorts them
(assuming your scheduler is accurate enough). Let's be clear, this is a stupid
way to sort numbers, but it's handy as a way to illustrate our ~monadicSequence~
function.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def delayedPrintNumber(s: Int): ZIO[Console with Clock,String,Int] = {
    putStrLn(s"Preparing to say number in $s seconds") *>
    putStrLn(s"$s").delay(s.seconds) *>
    ZIO.succeed(s)
}
val ios1 = List(6,5,2,1,3,8,4,7).map(delayedPrintNumber)
// ios1: List[ZIO[Console with Clock,String,Int]]
#+END_SRC

The function creates an IO effect, which when run will immediately print a
message and then wait ~s~ seconds before printing the number. We map the
function across a list of numbers to generate a list of IO effects, which we can
then run.

You may be surprised that this does not work. Instead of running all the effects
at once and printing them out in order it just executes the first IO (wait 6
seconds), then the second (wait 5 seconds).

#+BEGIN_SRC
Monadic version

Preparing to say number in 6 seconds
6
Preparing to say number in 5 seconds
5
// ... and so on for a while
#+END_SRC

If you were not surprised maybe you're ahead of me, and know that our
~monadicSequence~ function cannot possibly run all the effects at once by virtue
of it being monadic in the first place.

That ~for~ comprehension is really hiding that we are calling flatMap on each
successive IO, and flatMap sequences things together. You must wait for the
result of the first effect before you can evaluate the second. So whilst the
first implementation of ~sequence~ in the paper will absolutely work, it will
not let us implement our sleep sort, nor let us parallelize the IO's in general.

Back to the paper, at this point the authors observe...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the (c : cs) case, we collect the values of some effectful computations, which we
then use as the arguments to a pure function (:). We could avoid the need for names
to wire these values through to their point of usage if we had a kind of ‘effectful
application’.
#+END_QUOTE

By effectful application they are talking about the ~ap~ function, and they go
on to say that it lives in the Haskell Monad library. Given that function they
rewrite the ~sequence~ function as follows...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
sequence :: [IO a ] → IO [a ]
sequence [ ] = return [ ]
sequence (c : cs) = return (:) ‘ap‘ c ‘ap‘ sequence cs
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Except for the noise of the returns and aps, this definition is in a fairly standard
applicative style, even though effects are present.
#+END_QUOTE

Note that the ~ap~ they are using here is in the Monad library, and implemented
using flatMap, so it will not yet allow our sleep sort to work. However, I've
implemented an Applicative instance for ZIO which does not have that
limitation...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit def zioApplicative[Z,E] = new Applicative[ZIO[Z,E,?]] {
    def pure[A](x: A) = ZIO.succeed(x)
    def ap[A, B](ff: ZIO[Z,E,A => B])(fa: ZIO[Z,E,A]) = {
      map2(ff, fa){
        (f,a) =>
          f(a)
      }
    }
    override def map2[A, B, C](fa: ZIO[Z,E,A], fb: ZIO[Z,E,B])(f: (A, B) => C) :
      ZIO[Z,E,C] = {
        fa.zipPar(fb).map{case (a,b) => f(a,b)}
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

It's not important to understand all the details here, all you need understand
is we now have an ~ap~ that we can apply to ZIO effects that is truly parallel,
so if you're not interested then skip to the next paragraph.

#+BEGIN_aside
The ~pure~ function is straightforward, it just wraps a pure value in a
succeeded ZIO. The ~ap~ function is more interesting. Whilst it's not obvious
how you would implement ap in for ZIO, it is really easy to implement ~map2~.
~map2~ comes in handy because it lets you take the results of two effects and
pass them to a pure function. The function has the signature ~f: (A, B) => C~.
We use the ZIO function ~zipPar~ to execute the two effects _in parallel_, and
if both ~fa~ and ~fb~ yield values then they are mapped with the pure function
giving us a ZIO with the final result inside. Happily, you can implement ap in
terms of map2, so that solves our problem.
#+END_aside

Here's the conversion of the applicative version of ~sequence~ to Scala...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def applicativeSequence[Z,E,A](ios: List[ZIO[Z, E, A]]): ZIO[Z, E, List[A]] = {
    ios match {
      case Nil =>
        ZIO.succeed(List.empty[A])
      case c :: cs =>
        val ff: ZIO[Z,E, A => (List[A] => List[A])] =
          zioApplicative.pure(((a: A) => (listA: List[A]) => a +: listA))
        val p1 = ff.ap(c)
        p1.ap(applicativeSequence(cs))
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

It's a little bit noisier than the Haskell code, but most of that is having to
be more verbose about the types to keep the type checker happy. In fact the
parts of each implementation match up together.

Now we can run that and you will see that the effects are now parellelised and
our sleep sort works!

#+END_SRC

Note that the point the authors were making here was just to show that the
~sequence~ function is a pattern that came up often, that could be more
succinctly expressed with ~ap~. Showing that it also enables our effects to run
in parallel, given the correct implementation, was just to show one of the
benefits of avoiding Monad when effects are not dependent on each other.

**** Matrix Transposition
The second example in the paper is that of Matrix transposition, which takes a
matrix and flips it along a diagonal. For example...

#+BEGIN_SRC
Original matrix
 1  2  3  4  5
 6  7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15

Transposed matrix
 1  6 11
 2  7 12
 3  8 13
 4  9 14
 5 10 15
#+END_SRC

In Haskell, we first see this implememtation of transpose...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
transpose :: [[a ]] → [[a ]]
transpose [ ] = repeat [ ]
transpose (xs : xss) = zipWith (:) xs (transpose xss)

repeat :: a → [a ]
repeat x = x : repeat x
#+END_SRC

Let's translate this to Scala. The algorithm works by taking each row in turn
and /zipping/ it with each subsequent row.

First, we need to be careful about the function ~repeat~ which returns an
infinite number of whatever x is. This is used in the transpose for the last row
of the matrix where we want a number of empty lists to finish our recursion but
we don't know how many, so we want to just keep taking them. Since Haskell is by
default lazily evaluated this will work fine. In Scala as soon as we evaluate
repeat we will run into an infinite loop. That's easily fixed by switching to
~LazyList~ which is part of the standard library. (Before Scala 2.13 it was
called Stream).

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def repeat[A](a: A): LazyList[A] = a #:: repeat(a)
#+END_SRC

The function ~zipWith~ has the following type signature...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
#+END_SRC

In other words, it takes two lists and a pure function of two arguments, and
creates a new list by applying the function to each element. It will stop once
it runs out of elements in one of the lists. Here's the Scala version.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def zipWith[A, B, C](as: LazyList[A], bs: LazyList[B])(
      f: (A, B) => C): LazyList[C] = {
    as.zip(bs).map { case (a, b) => f(a, b) }
  }
#+END_SRC

With the pieces in place I can now implement the transpose as follows...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def transpose[A](matrix: LazyList[LazyList[A]]): LazyList[LazyList[A]] = {
  matrix match {
    case LazyList() => repeat(LazyList.empty)
    case xs #:: xss =>
      zipWith(xs, transpose(xss)) {
        case (a, as) =>
          a +: as
      }
  }
}
#+END_SRC

The next step in the paper is to make this look a bit more /applicative/ by
using a combination of ~repeat~ and ~zapp~...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
zapp :: [a → b ] → [a ] → [b ]
zapp (f : fs) (x : xs) = f x : zapp fs xs
zapp = [ ]

transpose :: [[a ]] → [[a ]]
transpose [ ] = repeat [ ]
transpose (xs : xss) = repeat (:) ‘zapp‘ xs ‘zapp‘ transpose xss
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Except for the noise of the repeats and zapps, this definition is in a fairly standard
applicative style, even though we are working with vectors.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Evaluating Expressions
The third example of applicative style is an expression evaluator that can add
numbers, both literals and numbers bound to strings and stored in an environment.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When implementing an evaluator for a language of expressions, it is customary to
pass around an environment, giving values to the free variables.
#+END_QUOTE

The Haskell code looks like this...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Exp v = Var v
  | Val Int
  | Add (Exp v) (Exp v)

eval :: Exp v → Env v → Int
eval (Var x ) γ = fetch x γ
eval (Val i) γ = i
eval (Add p q) γ = eval p γ + eval q γ
#+END_SRC

Converting to Scala is straightforward...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
sealed trait Exp
case class Val(value: Int) extends Exp
case class Add(left: Exp, right: Exp) extends Exp
case class Var(key: String) extends Exp

case class Env[K](kv: Map[K,Int])

def fetch(key: String)(env: Env[String]) : Int =
  env.kv.getOrElse(key, 0)

def eval(exp: Exp, env: Env[String]) : Int = {
  exp match {
    case Val(value) => value
    case Var(key) => fetch(key)(env)
    case Add(left, right) =>
      eval(left, env) + eval(right, env)
  }
}
#+END_SRC

Here I've made the environment a simple key value store, and, to avoid
complicating the example with error handling, if a variable is not present in
the environment I just default to returning zero.

Following the pattern of the previous two examples, the authors then pull some
magic to make the applicative pattern more noticeable...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We can eliminate the clutter of the explicitly threaded environment with a little
help from some very old friends, designed for this purpose
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
eval :: Exp v → Env v → Int
eval (Var x ) = fetch x
eval (Val i) = K i
eval (Add p q) = K (+) ‘S‘ eval p ‘S‘ eval q

where
K :: a → env → a
K x γ = x

S :: (env → a → b) → (env → a) → (env → b)
S ef es γ = (ef γ) (es γ)
#+END_SRC

So this all looks a bit cryptic. Who are the old friends? Well, if you look at
the type signature of ~K~ it is actually the ~pure~ function, and ~S~
is the ~ap~ function. This is in fact what we'd call the ~Reader~ Monad in
Scala.

By old friends, the authors are referring to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus][SKI Combinator Calculus]].

Let's reimplement in Scala using the ~Reader~.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def fetchR(key: String) = Reader[Map[String,Int], Int](env => env.getOrElse(key, 0))
def pureR(value: Int) = Reader[Map[String,Int], Int](env => value)

def evalR(exp: Exp): Reader[Map[String,Int], Int] = {
  exp match {
    case Val(value) => pureR(value)
    case Var(key) => fetchR(key)
    case Add(left, right) =>
      val f = Reader((env:Map[String,Int]) =>
        (a:Int) => (b:Int) => a + b)
      val leftEval = evalR(left).ap(f)
      evalR(right).ap(leftEval)
  }
}
#+END_SRC

And take it for a test drive...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val env1 = Env(Map("x" -> 3, "y" -> 10))
val exp1 = Add(Val(10), Add(Var("x"), Var("y")))

println(s"Eval : ${eval(exp1, env1)}")
// Eval : 23
#+END_SRC

*** The Applicative Type class
To summarize, we've seen three different effects used in applicative style; IO
(or ZIO), List and Reader. Now you can see why it makes sense to be able to
apply a function that is wrapped in these effects. What we needed, and got with
~ap~, is a way to lift a pure function so we can apply it to a chain of effects
of the same effect type.

Next in the paper, the authors describe the laws which an instance of the
Applicative type class must adhere to, which is out of scope for this post but
is put succinctly in English as follows...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The idea is that pure embeds pure computations into the pure fragment of an
effectful world—the resulting computations may thus be shunted around freely, as
long as the order of the genuinely effectful computations is preserved.
#+END_QUOTE

For more detail on the applicative laws check out chapter 12, section 5 of [[https://livebook.manning.com/book/functional-programming-in-scala/chapter-12/80][The Red Book]]

/Applicatives are all Functors/ (hence the name Applicative Functors), because
you can implement the map operation as follows...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
// Declare map in terms of pure and ap
def map[A,B,F[_]: Applicative](fa: F[A], f: A => B): F[B] = {
  Applicative[F].pure(f).ap(fa)
}

// Map a function over a list
map(List(1,2,3,4,5), (a:Int) => a + 1)
// res: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
#+END_SRC

Note that you don't have to do this with Cats instances because all
Applicatives have their Functor instance taken care of too.

The paper then notes that all uses of Applicatives follow this pattern of
lifting a pure function and applying it to a chain of effects, and suggests a
new syntax for shifting into the /Idiom/ of the applicative functor. The syntax
is a special pair of brackets...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
[[ ff f1 f2 f3 ... fn ]]

Although this has not been widely adopted in either Haskell or Scala as far as I
can tell, you can try it yourself using this delightfully named (and
implemented) Scala library: [[https://github.com/sammthomson/IdiomEars][Idiom Ears]]. This will let you closely match the
syntax from the paper; for example...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val f = (a: Int) => (b: Int) => a * b
⊏| (f) (List(1, 2)) (List(3, 4)) |⊐
// List(3, 4, 6, 8)

// Which is equivalent to
Applicative[List].pure(f).ap(List(1,2)).ap(List(3,4))
#+END_SRC

If you do fall in love with the idiom brackets of McBride and Patterson then
knock yourself out, but you may have to invest some time bringing the project
back to life as it has suffered some bitrot since 2016. There is a demo of
IdiomEars in the Github repository accompanying this post, but I simply copied
the code into my project rather than spend time updating it.

*** Moving right along to Traverse
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Have you noticed that sequence and transpose now look rather alike? The details
that distinguish the two programs are inferred by the compiler from their types.
Both are instances of the applicative distributor for lists.
#+END_QUOTE

At this point in the paper we have seen the birth of the Applicative type class
which encapsulates the ~ap~ and ~pure~ functions needed to implement the
patterns above. Next, the authors describe another new type class, ~Traverse~,
which lets us generalize the pattern further...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
dist :: Applicative f ⇒ [f a ] → f [a ]
dist [ ] = ⊏| [ ] |⊐
dist (v : vs) = ⊏| (:) v (dist vs) |⊐
#+END_SRC

Note that I'm using the unicode from Idiom Ears to replace the fancy brackets
from the paper which I cannot reproduce here, but you get the idea. Let's
rewrite in Scala...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
// applicative distributor for lists
def dist[A, F[_]](fs: List[F[A]])(implicit app: Applicative[F]): F[List[A]] = {
  fs match {
    case Nil =>
      app.pure(List.empty[A])
    case c :: cs =>
      val w1 = app.pure((a: A) => (listA: List[A]) => a +: listA)
      val w2 = w1.ap(c)
      w2.ap(dist(cs))
  }
}

// dist a list of options
println(dist(List(Option(10), Option(10), Option(3), Option(4))))
// Some(List(10, 10, 3, 4))

// Note that we have short circuiting
println(dist(List(None, Option(10), Option(3), Option(4))))
// None
#+END_SRC

Note that this short-circuits. We fail as soon as a single ~None~ shows up. Why?
It's because although applicative allows us to avoid the enforced sequencing of
Monad's flatMap, many types have instances of ~ap~ implemented in terms of
flatMap anyway, because that matches the expectation of users for that type.

We could override the Cats instance for Option with our own. What we do instead
is create Applicative versions of type classes. For example, our monadic friend
Either (which represents an error or a success value) has an applicative
alter-ego ~Validated~. Rather than short-circuit on failure, Validated allows us
to accumulate errors so we can provide valuable feeback ot the caller. That is one
of the super-powers of Applicatives!

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val someValidateds: List[Validated[NonEmptyList[String],Int]] =
  (List("Had some error".invalidNel, 10.valid, "Another error".invalidNel, 4.valid))

// Try the same with Validated that has an Applicative instance
println("Validated failure example: " + dist(someValidateds))
// Validated failure example: Invalid(NonEmptyList(Had some error, Another error))
#+END_SRC

Just by changing data types we have completely changed the behaviour from
short-circuiting to being able to /accumulate the errors/. Just imagine that these
are expensive computations or slow network calls, and you can see how avoiding
sequencing can really save us in computing costs, and thereby save us money.
Furthermore, we can improve user experience. We can validate a whole form from
the user at once and send all the corrections needed rather than necessitate a
painful back and forth until the whole form is valid. Now get back to ~dist~.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Distribution is often used together with ‘map’.
#+END_QUOTE

Fair enough. The ~dist~ function we developed above would be enhanced in
usefulness if it could map a list of pure values into some effect type first.
Let's take a look at a poor way to implement that...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
flakyMap :: (a → Maybe b) → [a ] → Maybe [b ]
flakyMap f ss = dist (fmap f ss)
#+END_SRC

We can translate pretty much directly to Scala...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def flakyMap[A,B](f: A => Option[B], as: List[A]): Option[List[B]] = {
  dist(as.map(f))
}

println("Flakymap success: " + flakyMap((n: Int) => Option(n * 2), List(1,2,3)))
// Flakymap success: Some(List(2, 4, 6))
println("Flakymap failure: " + flakyMap((n: Int) => if(n%2==1) Some(n) else None, List(1,2,3)))
// Flakymap failure: None
#+END_SRC

That's clearly useful, and it works, but it's flaky because we have to process
the list twice. First we map over the list to transform it, then we do it again
with the dist function. How about we do both at once? That's ~Traverse~...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
traverse :: Applicative f ⇒ (a → f b) → [a ] → f [b ]
traverse f [ ] = ⊏| [ ] |⊐
traverse f (x : xs) = ⊏| (:) (f x ) (traverse f xs) |⊐
#+END_SRC

And a Scala version...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def listTraverse[A, B, F[_]](f: A => F[B], fs: List[A])
     (implicit app: Applicative[F]): F[List[B]] = {
  fs match {
    case Nil =>
      app.pure(List.empty[B])
    case c :: cs =>
      val w1 = app.pure((b: B) => (listB: List[B]) => b +: listB)
      val w2 = w1.ap(f(c))
      w2.ap(listTraverse(f, cs))
  }
}
// Output is the same as flakyMap
#+END_SRC

By providing the identity function for ~f~ we get the ~sequence~ function back
in terms of traverse...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def sequence[A, F[_]](fs: List[F[A]])
    (implicit app: Applicative[F]): F[List[A]] = {
  listTraverse((fa: F[A]) => fa, fs)
}
#+END_SRC

Finally, we get to the Traverse type class, which gives us an interface to write
traverse for two effect types rather than just List and another effect. We have
two functions, traverse and dist, which are represented in Scala today as
traverse and sequence.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Traversable t where
traverse :: Applicative f ⇒ (a → f b) → t a → f (t b)
dist :: Applicative f ⇒ t (f a) → f (t a)
dist = traverse id
#+END_SRC

There's no need to show the Scala because we can reply on the implementations in
the Cats library, but the instance implementations for list are as above. In the
paper we see that you can also traverse more complex structures such as a
tree...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
sealed trait Tree[+A]
case object Leaf extends Tree[Nothing]
case class Node[A](left: Tree[A], a: A, right: Tree[A]) extends Tree[A]

def treeTraverse[A, B, F[_]](f: A => F[B], fs: Tree[A])
                (implicit app: Applicative[F]): F[Tree[B]] = {
  fs match {
    case Leaf =>
      app.pure(Leaf)
    case Node(left, a, right) =>
      val w1 = app.pure((l: Tree[B]) =>
        (v: B) =>
        (r: Tree[B]) => Node(l,v,r))
      val w2 = w1.ap(treeTraverse(f,left))
      val w3 = w2.ap(f(a))
      w3.ap(treeTraverse(f,right))
  }
}

val tree1 = Node(Leaf, 10, Node(Leaf, 5, Node(Leaf, 10, Leaf)))
println("treeTraverse: " + treeTraverse((n: Int) => Option(n + 1), tree1))
// treeTraverse: Some(Node(Leaf,11,Node(Leaf,6,Node(Leaf,11,Leaf))))
#+END_SRC

Note that in your own code you would usually lean on the Traverse type class and
override some methods to provide your own implementations.

Another thing to highlight the expressive power of traverse is that we can use
it to do a ~map~ just like a ~~Functor~ by using the Id (identity) Monad as our
effect type. The Id monad simply wraps a pure value and has no other effect, so
we can use it to use traverse as a functor as follows...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
@ List[Int](1,2,3).traverse((a: Int) => (1 + a): Id[Int])
// Id[List[Int]] = List(2, 3, 4)
#+END_SRC

*** Monoids are phantom Applicative functors
This section of the paper, part four if you are reading along, has an intriguing
title. Whilst short, there is a lot of information in a small space on how we
can use Monoids, Applicatives and Traverse to do some cool things. I will go
much slower than the paper as some of the concepts take some time to get your
head around.

Monoids are a type class that provides an interface to join things together such
as appending strings or adding numbers. In addition, they give us a way to
represent a zero value for the data type, which will be useful in a moment. If
you want to dig into Monoids in more detail I have written a couple of posts on
the subject...

- [[http://justinhj.github.io/2019/06/10/monoids-for-production.html][Monoids for Production [2019]​]]
- [[https://medium.com/yoppworks-reactive-systems/persistent-entities-with-monoids-a44212a157fb][Persistent Entities with Monoids [2020]​]]

**** Every Applicative is a Monoid
It's possible to implement a Monoid instance that works for any Applicative. In
Scala it looks like this...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit def appMonoid[A: Monoid, F[_]: Applicative] = new Monoid[F[A]] {
  def empty: F[A] = Applicative[F].pure((Monoid[A].empty))
  def combine(x: F[A], y: F[A]): F[A] =
    Applicative[F].map2(x,y)(Monoid[A].combine)
}
#+END_SRC

What does this give us? We can join Applicative Effects togther, and when we do
so they are joined in the =idiom= of the effect type. So for example when
combining a list with its default Monoid instance it will simply append the
lists like this...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
List(1,2,3) |+| List(4,5,6)
// res: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
#+END_SRC

But if instead we bring into scope a monoid for List we get the applicative
application instead...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit val m = appMonoid[Int, List]
List(1,2,3) |+| List(4,5,6)
// res: List[Int] = List(5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9)
#+END_SRC

**** Magical Folding with Traverse
It does not work the other way around, but some types with Monoid instances can
use those instances in their Applicative implementation. For example =Tuple2= in
the Cats library does just that. The actual implementation is split into two
because of the way the Cats class hierarchy is organized, so here's a simplified
version where it is more clear what's going on...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit def appTuple2[X: Monoid] = new Applicative[Tuple2[X,?]] {
  def pure[A](a: A): (X, A) = (Monoid[X].empty, a)

  def ap[A, B](ff: (X, A => B))(fa: (X, A)): (X, B) = {
    (ff._1.combine(fa._1),
     ff._2(fa._2))
  }
}
#+END_SRC

You can see how the fact that Monoids have an empty (or zero) value is useful
here because when we implement =pure= we need a value of type X to build the
response but we only have an A. By using the ~Monoid.empty~ function we can
fulfil the contract.

The implementation of ~ap~ is also interesting. What happens is that the X values
(which have a Monoid instance), are simply combined. The new value B is created
by applying the function in ff to the value in fa and now we have our new
Tuple2.

Recall the function signature for traverse on a List...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def traverse[G[_]: Applicative, A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => G[B]): G[List[B]]
#+END_SRC

The ~G~ in traverse is used to apply the function f to each element of our
collection, and so when we traverse and use Tuple2 as our G, it will use that
Monoid implementation we see above. Take a list and reducing it to a single
value is called various names including folding, reducing, crushing. In Scala
we'd typically fold a list of elements with a Monadic structure. We can now do
the same thing with traverse.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
Traverse[List].traverse(List[Int](1,2,3))((n: Int) => Tuple2(n,n))
// res: (Int, List[Int]) = (6, List(1, 2, 3))
#+END_SRC

You can see that the resulting tuple consists of two things, the sum of the
integers in the list (6) and second element is the list of results. That gives
us the ability to transform a collection into a an aggregated (folded) value,
and map it to a new collection at the same time!

Now often you may want to just fold the values and you don't care about the
other collection. In that case you could just drop it by calling ~._2~ on the
result.

There's a better way, and we can now move onto finding out about Phantom types
and how they can help us here.
**** Phantom types
Now we can rejoin the paper. We are introduced the ~Accy~ type which is called
~Const~ in Cats.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
newtype Accy o a = Acc{acc :: o }
#+END_SRC

In Scala the Const type can be implemented like this...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
final case class MyConst[A,B](unConst: A)
#+END_SRC

If it helps, this is a type level version of a function that takes two
parameters; an A and a B, and just drops the B returning the A...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def const[A, B](a: A)(b: => B): A = a
#+END_SRC

Const, or Accy, is a strange-looking data type that takes two type parameters,
and in fact takes two values, but we only store the first. This is why the
second parameter is called a ~phantom~. We can create a Const with any crazy
type we want for the ~B~ parameter because it won't be used at all...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import com.oracle.webservices.internal.api.message.MessageContext
Const[Int,MessageContext](12).getConst
// res: Int = 12
#+END_SRC

So what use is Const? For one, we can create an applicative functor for it just
like we did with Tuple, but now we can drop the pretense that we cared about the
second value and just get the folded value, saving us CPU time and memory as the
computation progresses...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
Traverse[List].traverse(List(1,2,3,4,5))(a => Const[Int, String](a)).getConst
// res: Int = 15
#+END_SRC

Let's convert the examples in the paper of using this technique into Scala...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
accumulate :: (Traversable t, Monoid o) ⇒ (a → o) → t a → o
accumulate f = acc · traverse (Acc · f )
reduce :: (Traversable t, Monoid o) ⇒ t o → o
reduce = accumulate id
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def accumulate[A,F[_]: Traverse, B: Monoid](f: A => B)(fa: F[A]): B = {
  Traverse[F].traverse(fa)((a: A) => Const.of[B](f(a))).getConst
}
def reduce[F[_]: Traverse, A: Monoid](fa: F[A]): A = {
  Traverse[F].traverse(fa)((a: A) => Const.of[A](a)).getConst
}
// Accumulate
println("accumulate: " + accumulate((s: String) => s.size)(List("ten", "twenty", "thirty")))
// 15

// Reduce
println("reduce: " + reduce(List("ten", "twenty", "thirty")))
// tentwentythirty
#+END_SRC

Note that we could implement reduce with accumulate as follows...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def reduceWithAccumulate[F[_]: Traverse, A: Monoid](fa: F[A]): A = {
  accumulate[A, F, A](identity)(fa)
}
#+END_SRC

We can also convert the following without much difficulty...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
flatten :: Tree a → [a ]
flatten = accumulate (:[ ])
concat :: [[a ]] → [a ]
concat = reduce
#+END_SRC

Scala versions...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def treeFlatten[A](tree: Tree[A]): List[A] = {
  accumulate((a: A) => List(a))(tree)
}

def concatLists[A](fa: List[List[A]]): List[A] = {
  reduce(fa)
}

// Tree flattening
println("treeFlatten: " + treeFlatten(tree1))
// treeFlatten: List(10, 5, 10)

// Concat lists (flatten)
println("concatLists: " + concatLists(List(List(1,2,3), List(4,5,6))))
// concatLists: List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
#+END_SRC

The last thing in this section is an example of how to find if a an element in a
list (or really anything we can Traverse) matches some predicate...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
newtype Mighty = Might{might :: Bool}

instance Monoid Mighty where
∅ = Might False
Might x ⊕ Might y = Might (x ∨ y)

any :: Traversable t ⇒ (a → Bool) → t a → Bool
any p = might · accumulate (Might · p)
#+END_SRC

What's going on here is that we get a new type called Mighty which has a Monoid
instance for it representing disjunction (boolean or). There is no default
Monoid for boolean in Cats so we have to define one first.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit val mightyBoolean = new Monoid[Boolean] {
  def empty = false
  def combine(a: Boolean, b: Boolean) = a || b
}

Traverse[List].traverse(List(1,2,3,4,5))(a =>
  if(a > 2) Const.of[Any](true)
  else Const.of[Any](false))
// res: Const[Boolean, List[Any]] = Const(true)

Traverse[List].traverse(List(1,2,3,4,5))(a =>
  if(a > 5) Const.of[Any](true)
  else Const.of[Any](false))
// res: Const[Boolean, List[Any]] = Const(false)
#+END_SRC

Instead of using boolean we can rely on the Integer addition boolean to count
how many times a predicate is matched in a traversable structure...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
Traverse[List].traverse(List(1,2,3,4,5))(a => if(a > 2) Const.of[Any](1) else Const.of[Any](0))
// res: Const[Int, List[Any]] = Const(3)
#+END_SRC

*** Comparing Monad with Applicative
We know that all Monads are Applicatives. Why? Because all Monads implement
~pure~ and they can also implement ~ap~ as follows...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def ap[A, B](ff: List[A => B])(fa: List[A]) = {
  ff.flatMap(f =>
    fa.map(f))
}
#+END_SRC

But all Applicatives are not Monads. For example you cannot implement flatMap
for Const...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def flatMap[A,B](fa: MyConst[X,A])(f: A => MyConst[X,B]): MyConst[X,B] = {
  val x = fa.unConst
  val a = ???
  // f(a)
  ???
}
#+END_SRC

We need an A to apply the function f, but there's no way to get one. Therefore
Const is no Monad.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
So now we know: there are strictly more Applicative functors than Monads. Should
we just throw the Monad class away and use Applicative instead? Of course not! The
reason there are fewer monads is just that the Monad structure is more powerful.
#+END_QUOTE

Next we contrast how Monad and Applicative differ in terms of a function called
miffy (for doing a monadic if) and iffy (an applicative if)...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def miffy[A, F[_]: Monad](mb: F[Boolean], fa: F[A], fb: F[A]): F[A] = {
  mb.flatMap{
    b =>
    if(b) fa
    else fb
  }
}

def iffy[A, F[_]: Applicative](mb: F[Boolean], fa: F[A], fb: F[A]): F[A] = {
  Applicative[F].map3(mb, fa, fb){
    case (cond, a, b) =>
      if(cond) a else b
  }
}

// miffy(Option(true), Option(1), None)
// res: Option[Int] = Some(1)

// iffy(Option(true), Option(1), None)
// res: Option[Int] = None
#+END_SRC

Here you can see that whilst miffy will succeed if the input is true even though
the else effect failed (it was None). But with the applicative version we have
to evaluate all the effects first, and if one of them fails they all fail.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The moral is this: if you’ve got an Applicative functor, that’s good; if you’ve also
got a Monad, that’s even better! And the dual of the moral is this: if you want a
Monad, that’s good; if you only want an Applicative functor, that’s even better!
#+END_QUOTE

**** Composing Applicatives
Not all Monads compose but all Applicatives do; /the Applicative class is closed
under composition/.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
instance (Applicative f ,Applicative g) ⇒ Applicative (f ◦ g) where
pure x = Comp J (pure x ) K
Comp fs ~ Comp xs = Comp J (~) fs xs K
#+END_SRC

What does it mean to compose an Applicative? It means that we get the effects of
both. For example we can use the full suite of Applicative functionality on a
List of Options...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val x: List[Option[Int]] = List(10.some, 9.some, 8.some)
val y: List[Option[Int]] = List(7.some, 6.some, 5.some)

Applicative[List].compose[Option].map2(x, y)(_ + _)
// List[Option[Int]] = List(Some(17), Some(16), Some(15),
//   Some(16), Some(15), Some(14),
//   Some(15), Some(14), Some(13))
#+END_SRC

**** Accumulating Exceptions
In this section, it's noted that we could accumulate errors from computations
using a type such as...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Except err a = OK a | Failed err
#+END_SRC

You may recognize this as Scala's ~Either~, which stores with an error or a
success in its Left and Right sides.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This could be used to collect errors by using the list monoid (as in unpublished
work by Duncan Coutts), or to summarise them in some way.
#+END_QUOTE

This is in fact exactly what we did when looking at the ~Validated~ type above.

*** Applicative functors and Arrows
In this section, the paper discusses ~arrows~ which have some similarities with
the ~Applicative~ interface, but it's out of scope for purposes of this blog
post. I may come back to it in a future post.

*** Applicative functors, categorically
We now see a different, but equivalent way to define the Applicative class. Take
a look at this Haskell code...

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Functor f ⇒ Monoidal f where
unit :: f ()
(*) :: f a → f b → f (a, b)
#+END_SRC

This means given a type f with a Functor instance, we can define the class
~Monoidal~. ~unit~ is the same as pure, whilst the * function takes two effects
and returns a new effect with the result tupled. This is implemented in Cats for
Applicative's and known as ~product~.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
Applicative[Option].product(Option(22),Option(20))
// res: Option[(Int, Int)] = Some((22, 20))
#+END_SRC

Let's show that we can implement Applicative if we have the product function
(assuming product is not implemented in terms of ap)...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
override def ap[F[_], A, B](ff: F[A => B])(fa: F[A]) = {
  product(ff,fa).map {
    case (f, a) =>
      f(a)
  }
}
#+END_SRC

Applicative can be implemented with ap and pure, or pure and product. We'll see
another choice later. Next in this section is some category theory which I'll
also skip for now, leaving only this quote for your interest...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fans of category theory will recognise the above laws as the properties of a lax
monoidal functor for the monoidal structure given by products.
#+END_QUOTE

**** We applied ourselves!
That's the end of McBride and Patterson's paper; here are some conclusions they
made...

- Applicative Functors have been identified
- They lie between Functor and Monad in power
- Unlike Monads, Applicatives are closed under composition
- Traverable Functors thread Applicative Applications and form a useful toolkit

The paper ends with a great quote that is both positive about borrowing ideas
from category theory...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The explosion of categorical structure in functional programming: monads,
comonads, arrows and now applicative functors should not, we suggest, be a cause
for alarm. Why should we not profit from whatever structure we can sniff out,
abstract and re-use? The challenge is to avoid a chaotic proliferation of
peculiar and incompatible notations.
#+END_QUOTE

Plug for idiom brackets was snipped.

** Back to Ap
So far in this post, we've seen lots of code that uses ap in various ways. We'll
wrap it up with some implementation notes on the useful function ~map2~, and how
we can arrive at needing the ~ap~ function to do so. Then we'll look at a
practical example of using Applicative in image processing.

Let's start with a problem. We have two functions that return Validated as
output. We want to call a pure function that takes two values as input. In short
we need map2...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
case class User(email: String, name: String, blocked: Boolean)
case class Account(email: String, balance: Long)

def getUser(email: String) =
  IO.sleep(10 seconds) *> IO(User("bob@gmail.com", "Bob Jones", false))

def getAccount(email: String) =
  IO.sleep(10 seconds) *> IO(Account("bob@gmail.com", 100))

def goodStanding(user: User, account: Account): Boolean = {
  user.blocked == false &&
  account.balance >= 0
}

val email = "bob@gmail.com"

val checkBob = Applicative[IO.Par].map2(
  Par(getUser(email)),
  Par(getAccount(email)))(goodStanding)

println("run bank check: " + Par.unwrap(checkBob).unsafeRunSync)
// run bank check: true
#+END_SRC

So this motivating example works, it runs the (simulated) slow network calls in
parallel and passes them to our function. (Note that this example is using Cats
Effect and in order to select Applicative rather than Monadic operation we need
to wrap the IO in the Par wrapper and then unwrap it at the end).

Given that map2 is a useful function how would we implement it? Just like we saw
at the start of the paper, we can use flatMap and map to implement it quite
easily...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def map2[A,B,C,F[_]: Monad](fa: F[A], fb: F[B])(f: (A,B) => C): F[C] =
  fa.flatMap { a =>
    fb.map(b => f(a,b))

That works fine, but sadly it requires that we complete fa before starting
and we want to allow independent effects. So we can't use Monad's flatMap. Let's
build the function without it...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def applicativeMap2[A,B,C,F[_]: Applicative](fa: F[A], fb: F[B])(f: (A,B) => C)
    : F[C] = {
  val ffb = fa.map {
    a => (b: B) => f(a,b)
  }
  Applicative[F].ap(ffb)(fb)
}
#+END_SRC

Obviously, there's no need to implement map2 because the Applicative instances
already have it, but it helps understand further the motivation for ap. The
value ~ffb~ is actually the result of currying the function ~f~. What we get
back is of the form ~F[B => C]~. We can then call that function using
Applicative's ~ap~ giving the correct response ~F[C]~.

By successively currying we can use the same trick to write map3, map4 and so on.

** Map2... does it blend?
So far we've seen some interesting uses of Applicative; accumulating errors
from network calls, managing multiple concurrent effects, transposing matrices,
evaluating expressions. In 2019 I wrote a blog post about Comonads that used the
coflatMap operation to do image processing. One of the takeaways from that post
is that one of the great advantages of functional programming is composability.
One thing I'd like to be able to do is to do operations on two images then blend
them together. In my original code images are stored represented as a
~FocusedGrid~ which is just an array of pixels and a focus point, which works
nicely for the coflatMap. The blend operation just needs a function to average
out the pixels and a map2...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def blend(a: (Int, Int, Int), b: (Int, Int, Int)): (Int, Int, Int) =
  ((a._1 + b._1) / 2, (a._2 + b._2) / 2, (a._3 + b._3) / 2)

val leftImage = originalImage2
val rightImage = originalImage2.coflatMap(mirrorHorizontal)
val upImage = originalImage2.coflatMap(mirrorVertical)
val downImage = rightImage.coflatMap(mirrorVertical)

val leftAndRight = Applicative[FocusedGrid].map2(leftImage, rightImage)(blend _)
val upAndDown = Applicative[FocusedGrid].map2(upImage, downImage)(
val finalImage = leftAndRight.map2(upAndDown)(blend _))
#+END_SRC

These few lines are all that is needed in user code to create the cows image at
the top of this post. If you want to know what the coflatMap is all about please
checkout my earlier post Comonads for Life or the related talk at Scale by the
Bay 2020 [[https://youtu.be/kVnJtiN1dbk][A gentle introduction to comonads]].

But in the background we also need to implement an Applicative instance for the
FocusedGrid datatype. Let's start with pure...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def pure[A](a: A): FocusedGrid[A] = FocusedGrid((0,0), Vector(Vector(a)))
#+END_SRC

Just like with the pure function for a List Applicative (or Monad), all we do is
lift a pure value into a FocusedGrid with a singe row and column.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def ap[A, B](ff: FocusedGrid[A => B])(fa: FocusedGrid[A]): FocusedGrid[B] = {
  val newGrid = ff.grid.mapWithIndex {
    (row, i) =>
    row.zip(fa.grid(i)).map {
      case (f, a) =>
        f(a)
    }
  }
  FocusedGrid(ff.focus, newGrid)
}
#+END_SRC

Remember that with List we implemented an Applicative instance that took all the
functions in the input list and applied them in turn to each element in the list
of parameters. Ap for FocusedGrid iterates over a /grid of functions/ and
applies them to the target row and column in the input parameter.

Our work is done; with pure and ap implemented we now have a fully working
Applicative instance and that means map2 will work.

** Post-mature optimisation
Most of the time, solving day to day business problems, we don't have to worry to
much about performance, but when it comes to things like image processing when
we are dealing with large numbers of pixels it can be more important to know
what is going on under the hood, and when to step in and improve it. Profiling
should be your guide, but if you look at the default implementation of map2 in
Cats you can see that it is doing a lot of work that is not needed ...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
map(product(fa, fb))(f.tupled)
#+END_SRC

And product is ...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
ap(map(fa)(a => (b: B) => (a, b)))(fb)
#+END_SRC

So with a square image of size 2000 pixels (4 million total), to perform a map2
we are going to map of the image twice; once to create an image of curried
functions and a second time to apply them. In addition, we're going to create a
lot temporary data that we don't need.

Fortunately there's nothing to stop you from instead of using the default
implementation of map2 we can implement our own...

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
override def map2[A, B, Z](fa: FocusedGrid[A], fb: FocusedGrid[B])(f: (A, B) => Z): FocusedGrid[Z] = {
  val faRowIter = fa.grid.iterator
  val fbRowIter = fb.grid.iterator
  val rowBuilder = Vector.newBuilder[Vector[Z]]

  while(faRowIter.hasNext && fbRowIter.hasNext) {
    val faColIter = faRowIter.next.iterator
    val fbColIter = fbRowIter.next.iterator
    val colBuilder = Vector.newBuilder[Z]

    while(faColIter.hasNext && fbColIter.hasNext) {
      colBuilder.addOne(f(faColIter.next, fbColIter.next))
    }
    rowBuilder.addOne(colBuilder.result)
  }
  FocusedGrid(fa.focus, rowBuilder.result)
}
#+END_SRC

Here we make a much more efficient implementation that instead of creating
temporary data structures will use an iterator on each input grid and a Vector
builder to efficiently build the output. This is maybe not /the/ fastest
implementation but it's certainly doing a lot less work. Of course optimizing
without profiling is a waste of time. I had heard that Array is much faster than
Vector for this kind of use case, so the sample code also includes an Array
implementation. The code is somewhat ugly due to some technical constraints
around Array, and turned out not to be any faster!

In any case, should you want to explore this further, the instructions are all
in the accompanying code to do you run your own benchmarks using =jmh=.

Here's the results from my own benchmarking...

| Benchmark                           | Mode | Cnt |      Score | Error |      Units |       |
|-------------------------------------+------+-----+------------+-------+------------+-------|
| FocusedGridArrayBench.withMap2Large | avgt |   5 | 171099.587 | ±     |  65471.687 | us/op |
| FocusedGridArrayBench.withMap2Small | avgt |   5 |     54.418 | ±     |     25.669 | us/op |
| FocusedGridBench.withMap2Large      | avgt |   5 | 152831.655 | ±     |  40709.521 | us/op |
| FocusedGridBench.withMap2Small      | avgt |   5 |     59.168 | ±     |     15.346 | us/op |
| FocusedGridBench.withSlowApLarge    | avgt |   5 | 649442.291 | ±     | 215248.298 | us/op |
| FocusedGridBench.withSlowApSmall    | avgt |   5 |    141.025 | ±     |     78.928 | us/op |


What is notable that optimized map2 is 4x faster on the large image than slowAp
and the array version is actually slower than the vector version. Just goes to
show, if performance matters then always benchmark your original code and your
solution to make sure your assumptions are correct. There's also a balance
between opimised code keeping your code easy to read and reason about.

This post was going to be a five-minute thing but blew up into a monster and
there are still things that I didn't get to. Some things I may visit in the
future:
- Composition - examples of composing Functors and Applicatives
- Arrows
- Laws of Applicatives (although they are covered nicely elsewhere)
- Category theory (esp. of lax monoidal functors in more depth)
